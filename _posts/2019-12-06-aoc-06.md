Solving Advent of Code 2019-06 with R (and no JavaScript this time).

\[Disclaimer\] Obviously, this post contains a big spoiler about Advent
of Code, as it gives solutions for solving day 6.

## Instructions

Find the instructions at: <https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/6>

## R solution

### Part one

``` r
library(magrittr)
library(igraph)
```

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'igraph'

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
    ## 
    ##     decompose, spectrum

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:base':
    ## 
    ##     union

``` r
ipt <- read.delim("input6.txt", header = FALSE, sep = ")", stringsAsFactor = FALSE)
grph <- ipt %>% 
  graph_from_data_frame() 

grph %>% 
  distance_table() %>% 
  extract2("res") %>% 
  sum()
```

    ## [1] 147807

### Part two

``` r
distances(
  grph, 
  v = V(grph)[["YOU"]], 
  to = V(grph)[["SAN"]]
) - 2
```

    ##     SAN
    ## YOU 229

## JS solution

> Nop, no JS solution today… I didn’t feel like reimplementing igraph in
> JavaScript, neither digging into the graph modules today ;)
