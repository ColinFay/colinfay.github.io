I'm so, so excited to announce that the _'Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps'_ book is now available in print! 
This book is the result of two years of work, and I couldn't be more happy to see it available in print.

As its title suggests, _'Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps'_ is a book about building `{shiny}` apps that  will be sent to production. 
It goes deep into `{golem}`, of course, but it's not a book about `{golem}` only --- it tries to cover a large panel of topics, and I'm pretty sure that if you are a `{shiny}` developer, there is something for you in this book: project management, code organization, team work, best practices for front end development, CI and CD, deployment, code optimization...

This book will remain available online for free at <https://engineering-shiny.org/> (and I want to thank Chapman and Hall/CRC for this), but if you want to grab a copy, you can go on [routledge.com](https://www.routledge.com/Engineering-Production-Grade-Shiny-Apps/Fay-Rochette-Guyader-Girard/p/book/9780367466022) and order one. 
I know it can feel counter-intuitive to buy a print copy of a book which is available online, but if you want this to continue to happen, please continue to support the publisher by buying a copy of this book, or of any other from Chapman and Hall/CRC --- they have been doing a massive work when it comes to organizing, editing and reviewing.

I want to personally thank everybody that has been contributing to this book, with some special thanks to [Eric Nantz](https://twitter.com/theRcast) which has been a `{golem}` early adapter and an all time supporter of everything from the `golemverse`, to [David Granjon](https://twitter.com/divadnojnarg) for all his feedback on the book, and to [Christophe Dervieux](https://twitter.com/chrisderv) for his precious help during my battles with Markdown. 
Thanks also to [David Grubbs](https://twitter.com/crcgrubbsd) from Chapman and Hall/CRC for making this happen.

That being said, I still can't believe I've added my name to the list of authors in "The R Series" books ðŸ˜±

I hope you'll enjoy it!
