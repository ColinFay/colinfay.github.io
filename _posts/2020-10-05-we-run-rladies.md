Hey internet, it’s me again\!

If you follow this blog, you’ve seen two weeks ago that we launched a
“Run for RLadies” online event, where you could sponsor runners from
the [RStats Strava Club](https://www.strava.com/clubs/rstats) (and
others), by matching 1$/€ by km run during a run made on the week-end of
the 3rf and 4th of October.

Here is a short summary of how much km each runner run:

  - Colin F - 21,10 km
  - Jacquie T - 15,02 km
  - Benjamin M - 21,10 km
  - Wal M - 10,01 km
  - Megan B - 30,1 km
  - Theoni P - 7 km
  - Johne P - 9,35 km

**What to do now?**

If you’re a sponsor, and even if you’re not, you can do a donation to
RLadies using the “Donate” button on their
[website](https://rladies.org/): it’s on the bottom right corner if
you’re on a computer, and on the very bottom if you’re on a mobile 💪.
If you have a PayPal account, the process takes about 20 seconds ;)

If you don’t want/are not able to match the distance run by a specific
runner, you can also do a donation of any amount: it can be $1, $2, $10…
anything helps\! For example, a Zoom pro account (for 500 users), costs
around $200 a year: that’s 20 people donating $10 (of course, RLadies
are free to do what they want with the donation, I just wanted to show
that every donation, whatever the amount, can help ;) ).
