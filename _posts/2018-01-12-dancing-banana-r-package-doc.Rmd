Having fun playing around with R documentation and HTML.

#----#

I found out today that you could [easily insert html and JS](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/951838799918755842) into R help pages, as I walked into Clippy when reading the [{writexl} package documentation](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/951819899248283651). 

So, if like me you're curious about how, here's a short how-to. 

## Playing with the .Rd

A package documentation is composed of `.Rd` files, which live (when developping) in the `/man` folder of your source package. They are made of LaTeX, but nowadays we rarely write LaTeX by hand, and rely on {roxygen2} for doing the heavy lifting for package documentation. But still, you can write LaTeX code into these roxygen comments, put on top on your functions in your `.R`. That's the trick I'm gonna used, borrowed to Jeroen {writexl}'s code. 

I saw it was possible to insert arbitrary HTML and JS by using, as a roxygen comment, a combination of: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
#' \if{html}{
#' \out{
#' Your HTML here
#' }}
```

With that, the HTML/JS code pops up at the bottom of the documentation, when calling help with `?myfun`, or simply by opening the help page. 

So basically, if I put : 

```{r eval = FALSE}
#' \if{html}{
#' \out{
#'  <img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/IB9foBA4PVkKA/giphy.gif">
#' }}
#'
```

The documentation goes:

I don't know LaTeX, so I can't perfectly explain how it works, but the code is pretty straightforward, so we can easily guess the `\if{html}` tests if the code is run in an html page, and if it is, the HTML code is inserted. If this is not what happens, I'll be glad to here some explanation about that, so feel free to comment below. 

## Insert YouTube video

Of course, this could be more useful, like, putting a gif with a code example, or a video with a tutorial. 

But I guess it's still better to get [rickrolled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), so here's the code to do that (but if you have mercy for your users, turn the autoplay off by changing to `autoplay=0`  ;) ):

```{r eval = FALSE}
#' \if{html}{
#' \out{
#'<iframe width="420" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
#' }}
#'
```
