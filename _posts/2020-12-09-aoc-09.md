Solving Advent of Code 2020-09 with R & Neo4j.

\[Disclaimer\] Obviously, this post contains a big spoiler about Advent
of Code.

## Instructions

We have a `XMAS` code, which:

  - Start with 25 numbers

  - Any following number should be the sum of one of the possible pairs
    from the previous 25

  - In step 2, find the consecutive set of number that sums to the
    result of part 1, and add its min and max

Find the complete instructions at:
<https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/9>.

## R solution

### Part one

``` r
# Reading the data
input <- read.delim(
  sep = " ",
  "2020-09-aoc.txt",
  header = FALSE,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

for (i in 26:length(input$V1)){
  # The 25 starting numbers
  to_get <- (i - 25):(i-1)

  # The 26th number should be between the
  # sum of the two lowest number and the sum
  # of the two highest
  lower_bond <- sum(
    head(
      sort(input$V1[to_get]),
      2
    )
  )

  higher_bond <- sum(
    tail(
      sort(
        input$V1[to_get]
      ),
      2
    )
  )

  if (
    !dplyr:::between(input$V1[i], lower_bond, higher_bond)
  ){
    output1 <<- input$V1[i]
    print(output1)
    break

  }
}
```

### Part Two

``` r
for (i in 1:length(input$V1)){
  # We will try to find any sequence in 1:n, then 2:n,
  # then 3:n, etc, that sums to output1
  selection <- input$V1[i:length(input$V1)]
  c_s <- cumsum(selection) == output1
  if (
    any(c_s)
  ){
    bounds <- selection[1:which(c_s)]

    print(
      sum(
        min(bounds),
        max(bounds)
      )
    )
    break
  }
}
```
