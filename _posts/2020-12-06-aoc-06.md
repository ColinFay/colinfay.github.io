## R solution

### Part one

``` r
library(magrittr)
library(purrr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
# Read the data
readLines("2020-06-aoc.txt" ) %>%
  # pasting everything into one big character string
  paste(collapse = "\n") %>%
  # splitting where there are two \n\n (new lines)
  strsplit("\n\n") %>%
  .[[1]] %>%
  map_dbl(~ {
    # Removing the new lines of each group
    .x <- gsub("\n", "", .x)
    # Splitting the string
    strsplit(.x, "") %>%
      .[[1]] %>%
      # Computing the number of unique answer
      unique() %>%
      length()
  }) %>%
  sum()
```

### Part two

``` r
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
# Read the data
readLines("2020-06-aoc.txt" ) %>%
  # pasting everything into one big character string
  paste(collapse = "\n") %>%
  # splitting where there are two \n\n (new lines)
  strsplit("\n\n") %>%
  .[[1]] %>%
  map_dbl(~ {
    # Removing the new lines of each group
    x <- strsplit(.x, "\n")[[1]]
    # Getting the group size
    ngroup <- length(x)
    # Splitting the original string
    strsplit(.x, "")[[1]] %>%
      data.frame(
        x = .
      ) %>%
      # Counting the number of occurrences of each letter
      count(x) %>%
      # Keeping only the questions that occur in all
      filter(n == ngroup) %>%
      nrow()
  }) %>%
  sum()
```
