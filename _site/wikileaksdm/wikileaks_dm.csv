SW has given an interview to Valenti as part of the package.,2015-08-18 05:15:27,WikiLeaks
"SW is on record many times early in the case denying having been raped and accusing the police, so they have an up hill battle",2015-08-18 05:16:59,WikiLeaks

"The Samira Shackle not that bad – at least quotes Carey for a full para.

"“Whether she is able to remain anonymous or not, and even though her story of being raped has not been disproven, the fact that Jackie is not and was not a symbol or a cause, but a person, has been lost in the rush to indict her and anyone who believes her.

"Jackie was subsequently shown to be a fraud, but Valenti was correct to say “I lose nothing by doing so, even if I’m later proven wrong”.

"It is the use of tools of social exclusion (oppression) that are perceived to have been (and be being) used against them. What (as Bella puts it) ‘old-skool feminism’ does is reject those tools altogether. Experience shld be heard and has it’s own legitimate space, and this is of its essence an emotional space – people’s personal narrative is a vital part of the truth. That can be as expressed in as extreme a way as people’s emotions are.

"I think it’s also a fallacy to say that journalism is ‘objective’ except in cases where the evidence is clearly and openly provided, as Wikileaks has sought to do by making all documents available. Yet, even the straight out “x happened” can be shaded by personal bias. That’s a big issue in research and it reminds me of the difference between ‘analytic’ or ‘quantitative’ studies vs qualitative studies, where the latter deliberately explore personal experience and narrative. The issue is that even the best ‘analytic’ research always has some level of potential bias and when evaluating it, the risk of bias must be considered. I’d rather see journalists who are capable of recognizing and accounting for their personal biases, willing to minimize those by providing documentary evidence, but without the false pretense of objectivity, as it seems that those who cry the loudest about being objective are usually the most biased.",2015-08-19 08:15:49,LibertarianLibrarian

The piece is kind of ‘languid’, flits about. Probably because he is unfamiliar with/uninterested in the real issues (as in geopolitics/justice/truth etc!). But he doesn’t go on about the Swedish case at all; there’s much more about the US case, which he seems to take at face-value (despite that quote fr Appleyard). So it’s good in that it doesn’t belittle the threat to Assange even saying “he may be right about that” w ref to JA’s conviction that Ny’s delaying tactics are to serve the US timescale, enable them to build their case. The worst thing is, that, apart from a ref to the “horrifying footage” of Collateral Murder, he has no regard for/understanding of the ground-breaking work of WikiLeaks, or JA’s role (so, what’s new?). It ends with the terrible “he’s a hero to many in the land of protest for protest’s sake” after citing who he’s a villain to and why.

"Very very interesting article, thank you Hazelpress! Anyway, I completely agree on the “astonishing, terrifying”. It’s alarming that those war game was done on hypothesis for 2015 – hypothesis that actually are happening now. And I find quite scaring (though really telling) that the only way the Five Eyes are finding to deal with climate change is extending the scope of their control over citizens, exercizing more surveillance, both with the May 2013 “emergency authority” and all the different laws to “outlaw/limit protests”. Instead, on the political side, they are doing pretty well, no important political agreement/solutions have been reached (quite the opposite, the latest Artic drilling issue shows). They think the solution to everything is more control — or maybe it’s convenient for them to think so.",2015-09-02 09:43:38,voidiss

"Interestingly, although TPP subtitles the article “The Press Project in collaboration with WikiLeaks…” and atributes extensively to WL by referral to the docs released, they do not directly link to the http://wikileaks.org",2015-09-05 15:09:12,Emmy B

The concluding paragraph says “The European Council approved the military assistance against Assad in Syria in recent years and helped to equip the rebels (later named ISIS who stained with the region with blood) once again respond with military interventions to one of the most complex immigration problems. The ThePressProject already took the initiative of collecting signatures for the reversal of the European Commission policy. Instead of spending millions of euros on the bombing of civilian infrastructure and the dealing with the “public relations management” of the problem we propose the creation of humanitarian structures for documents (visas) at the nodes/centres of movement of refugees in order not to see more drowned children washed up on the Mediterranean seas.”,2015-09-05 15:17:13,Emmy B

"In Greece we all celebrate proudly the day of oxi = no (1940 – WWII). It was not actually said as such but this is how it remains in history… as a ‘no you cannot pass your armies into Greece through the Albanian border Mussolini, we shall fight’. Together with the slight distortion of history (the word ‘no’ never was said, although Greece did not acquiesce to the Italian army advance and fought) most Greeks forget that Metaxas, the politician in charge of Greece at the time was a brutal dictator. He was a confirmed fascist who propagated everything that Mussolini and Hitler propagated albeit in a ancient Greek toga intellectual ‘garment’. Assad equally is a political dictator albeit considering the plurality of religions and nations within Syria, he is also the ‘tribal chief’ of the Allawites. Forgive me I am hardly an expert in matters Syrian but there is no doubt in my mind the Greeks would rather have Metaxa the dictator than Mussolini the dictator. I think most people can understand why. Mussolini too had a plan to split Greece into parts and in fact during the 4 years of occupation Greece was split into three parts The Italian, The German, The Bulgarian. Out of all three the Bulgarian was considered the most barbaric as ethnic cleansing was part of the agenda to truly expand Bulgaria giving it access into the Aegean. The current problems between Greece and FYROM or Macedonia over the name stem from that period of Bulgarian occupation when the occupiers (Bulgarians) to consolidate their rule and cement it for the future created the ‘greater Macedonia’ claiming it as a separate state, nation, in fact, and starting to manufacture the historic revisionism so helpful in propaganda. If the occupation had lasted longer than 4 years the map of Greece would today be very different. FYROM to this day includes in its national constitution a commitment to ‘liberate’ those historic lands that are currently under foreign control… all this referring to ‘the Greater Macedonian Myth’ created by Bulgarians in the 40’s. Forgive me the rather long dive into Greek history but I think it says a parallel story.",2015-09-13 11:13:55,Emmy B

"Today is reported that Merkel said the Greeks should do a better job in guarding the EU’s external borders. A little too late, comes the realisation that indeed Greece is a border fortress. But interestingly NATO’s Greek military plan, executed at the cost of the Greek tax payer has been mainly deployed for an eminent USSR attack and not by an attack military or otherwise from any other direction. If the poor dingies can cross from Turkey to the Greek islands so easily, imagine how quickly modern military vessels can cross over and of course they trespass daily, who in EU has ever cared? I do hope that Isis does not spread into Turkey (God forbid they feed the monster, can they control it?) or else ‘island hopping’ the dream of every EU travelling teenager will acquire a very different meaning.",2015-09-13 13:24:00,Emmy B

"I quote ” Sarah Palin, possibly the next US President, called for him to be pursued “with the same urgency we pursue al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders.” No doubt her supporters were able to read what they liked into that remark.

"Thanks for the resources Bean 🙂 good to know, I have no particular knowledge of who is who in Australian politics. His expressed views regarding JA/WL as expressed in the podcast lecture to Sydney Uni is widely differentiated than other Australian politicians. In particular I am not aware that anyone has ever given a Uni lecture on the matter so in that respect he may find it hard to publicly retract all 41 minutes of it.",2015-09-14 06:29:08,Emmy B

But… this is what @garymlord thinks about those MT’s words:",2015-09-14 06:30:37,voidiss
"Also, given what Bean has just said and comparing it with how Australiam MSM are depicting him, there’s a discordance: http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/liberal-leadership-the-malcolm-turnbull-doctrine-telling-the-truth-about-economy-20150914-gjmfyc.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=nc&eid=socialn%3Atwi-13omn1677-edtrl-other%3Annn-17%2F02%2F2014-edtrs_socialshare-all-nnn-nnn-vars-o%26sa%3DD%26usg%3DALhdy28zsr6qiq",2015-09-14 06:31:32,voidiss

would he still do this in power? – i’m sceptical – haven’t time to expand or find decent material on him at the moment (sorry!) – but my impression of him over the years is as a very slippery character – a cunning manipulator,2015-09-14 06:45:13,Bean

"Jenny wonderful you helped him with his english! I thought it was well written <3 Greek society was very much in flux as I was growing up there, huge differences in attitudes btw city and country for example and from social group to social group. In general women had it tough in a patriarchal society (not to ignore that patriarchy limits mens freedom too not just women’s) but my generation had many more opportunities that ever before which went hand in hand with political developments for the better across society. One here in the UK would laugh to read that some occupational insurance funds in Greece would pay out pensions to unmarried women if their father passed away for example but this was a recognition that ‘in those days’ women could not be financially independent through outside paid work. Other provisions like first born boys of a widow or divorced woman would get reduced time in National Service as they were considered head of the family, i.e. financially providing for their mothers and other dependent members… I mean where do you put such arrangements in the grand literature of feminism? Do we have to permeate every aspect of our social being with ideology? Can’t we just ‘be’?",2015-10-14 08:55:30,Emmy B
"It’s saddening, deeply saddening. Once innovative and strong movements such as feminism are turning into a doctrine. Feminism started long ago and it was a wave of change… I remember the suffragettes in ‘900, for example; Alice Paul and women’s right to vote in America. They protested and fight and even were jailed for this, they represented a strong dissent. And now… now feminism is the emobiement of stagnation. It can be used to promote a certain propaganda, to censor and to defend only a close group’s human rights leaving out all the rest to be destroyed: But more than this, it is ‘conquering the term’; I mean, real feminism isn’t that “trigger warning”/”rape culture” crap, but this flawed part of feminism has grown and grown and of course — as every other conservative/reactionary ideology — has got the better of true feminism and crippled it by becoming the widespread conception of the term. Now everyone who wants to make people know that cares about women’s rights and has desire to fight for them, has to define himself/herself feminist, because if you don’t do, you have less credibility in the realm of feminism, but by doing so you’re indirectly endorsing a doctrine which is wrong and obliges you to adapt to it if you don’t want to be left out.",2015-10-14 09:34:12,voidiss
"And this hyper-sensitivity in colleges, this “microaggression” thing, is slowly building up an environment which should stay in a dystopian book, not in our reality. An environment in which everyone must be always kind to everyone, in which everyone must only express accepted views in a group think system and leave out dissenting/radical opinion. And again, all this just helps to value more well-being instead of free speech – expressed with other words, but it’s the same old contrast of security vs freedom so loved by NSA and every govt. Another symptom of this widespread culture which molds people into living and dissolving into their restricted area of comfort, without daring to go out of it, challenge the order. Family, job, money. If they have this, they are happy and all the rest can die in front of their eyes and they won’t see. And hypocritically they keep saying “ah, this world is shit, I’d like to see it change” but then they do nothing to actually change it. “I would but I can’t”.",2015-10-14 09:34:20,voidiss

"Yes, I can remember in college arguing with ‘feminists’ that I had an equal right to choose between a career or staying home and raising kidd and being told I didn’t, that if I chose the latter, I was participating in the patriarchal system, etc. If you don’t accept and parrot their exact ideology, you’re labeled as ‘antifeminist’ which is an insult without real meaning but gets easily thrown at anyone they don’t like. As you say, dissent or alternative ideas are not allowed. The ideology becomes rigid. It also tends towards defining another group as evil by nature not by action, i.e., if you’re male you are automatically bad. This happens often and is why I’ve always hated to identify myself as anything other than an individualist and a humanist. I’ve been supporting Black Lives Matter because the situation is so bad right now, but really, for me, it’s about equal treatment before the law for all. Not special treatment in either direction, but the same.

"During the junta years 1969-1974 in Greece most newspapers continued their operation, self censoring. It was a most brutal dictatorship, thousands tortured as a control, punitive and reformative process, still Greek society continued to function and newspapers continued to operate. Yes there were individual cases of resistance and some efforts for organised revolt in a small scale but nothing in a grand scale. Institutions adjusted their behaviour to the new situation and found ways to turn a blind eye or partly justify their position by quietly acquiescing. In the end the junta imploded from within. It was the army generals who decided to bring a return to democracy. They were dismayed at the junta’s treasonous effort to overthrow unsuccessfully the democratic government of Cyprus, handing Turkey the premeditated ‘way in’ to invade and partition the island. Having committed in effect National Treason of the greatest degree in opening the door to the brutal enemy’s worst plans, some generals and right wing politicians came to an accord, to bring back Karamanlis, restore democracy in return for impunity for the treason, and impunity for most of the junta’s crimes. I bring this as an example to illustrate the sad fact that Democracy and what it means to our society is only as precious as we give it and the value of its currency is only determined by the action we are prepared to take to keep it safe.",2015-10-29 03:30:25,Emmy B

"Official Greek position regarding Paris aftermath: 1. Greece will not participate in any military operation in Syria as part of NATO, its role in the crisis is to remain a stable partner. 2. Solution for avoiding such terror attacks is the exchange of info among Nato countries intelligence services. With regards to backlash on Refugee crisis. 1. Greek army’s role is defensive, it will support refugee crisis but will not be managing it, i.e. Greece is treating the migration move as a humanitarian crisis not as a enemies that the army has to defend against. Coast Guard, Frontex and other civil institutions are managing the situation under civilian management. 2. There will be no joint Greek Turkish patrols in Greek territorial waters. (Reminding people there are no international waters between Greek and Turkish sea border, Turkey does not recognise Greek sovereignty in half the Aegean, basically does what it likes when it suits). Joint Greek/Turkish coast guard exists albeit Turkish coast guard is better equipped than Greek and since they let the dingies leave their coast without intercepting them anyway, I just can’t see how they can suddenly intercept them if they are to go into Greek waters. In Turkish waters are invisible and suddenly in Greek waters are visible?",2015-11-16 02:48:28,Emmy B
"Greek Navy is not involved in the operations currently but Turks will bring them in (remember they do what they like their navy already trespasses frequently and forces the Greek navy and airforce to be shadowing them around). If Turkish navy get’s an in then Greek Navy is forced to participate, then the scene is set for skirmishes and red alert tensions on a daily bases btw Turkish/Greek vessels. If anyone thinks all this has anything to do with saving refugees they can think again, consider what we are dealing with: 1. desperate people 2. ruthless traffickers 3. flimsy dingies. Why, if military vessel as much as approach one of these dinghies the waves they makes might just topple the dingy, not to mention that Traffickers advise refugees that the moment they see the coast guard to sink the dingy so then coast guard is forced to launch a saving operation rather than toe them back to the sea border and co-ordinate with Turkish coast guard to pick them up (this used to happen a lot where some small vessels were forced to return to Turkey) With the weather deteriorating from week to week the death toll increases, the journey is even more perilous.",2015-11-16 02:56:57,Emmy B

Extremely important article on Greek Satirical Magazine ‘To Pondiki’ issue published 12/11/2015 regarding National Security and Sovereignty implications of TiSA with regards to the Aegean. It refers heavily on earlier WikiLeaks release on TiSA via local Partner Kathimerini to highlight that current EU policy via Merkel and Junker (pressurising Greece to accept Turkish involvement in ‘guarding’ Greek sea borders regarding the influx of immigrants/refugees) reflects commitments that EU has already made to Turkey via TiSA reminding that Turkey was responsible for formulating the TiSA naval/sea chapter and as a result it formulated it in a manner to protect and enhance its own interests to the detriment of the Greek interests and sovereignty.,2015-11-16 04:33:45,Emmy B

In today’s Brussel’s EU meeting of Ministers of defence Greek position re France: EU and Nato need to co-operate through the exchange of information held by secret services. on question regarding Greek Army guarding the borders Greek Mod re-iterated previous position The border with Turkey is the Aegean sea. If Greek Army(Navy) is deployed this mean we will killing children and this is impossible. They are refugees.,2015-11-17 05:36:03,Emmy B
"This reflects the general position in Greece that Army is for killing enemies when they invade rather than the current wave of expectation that Armies should be used in dealing with the refugee crisis.

Please allow me a little rant regarding the fear of terror and how governments are using this to limit freedoms. This is entirely avoidable and I bring once more the example of my little modest very insignificant country….,2015-11-19 13:26:25,Emmy B
"Several times whilst I lived there I and the rest of society experienced intense fear about an imminent invasion (M/V Piri Reis “was sent in 1987 to Aegean Sea after Greece announced that it will start oil and gas exploration in the region. As Greece declared to intervene, Turkey responded that this would be cause of war. The tension calmed down later with mediation efforts of NATO and the USA.”), Imagine going down to the supermarket on an errant to find the shelves empty from panic buying… the threat was as is now real. At the same time I remember both the activities of the 17th of November dominating the headlines, the activities of Mossad against the Palestinians and the police brutality in marches etc still, all these threats never became a reason to hold societal progress in the 80’s and 90’s which was unstoppable.",2015-11-19 13:37:15,Emmy B

"Unofficial Game: Having deposed the Kemalist fraction from controlling the deep state including large part of the army/police/MIT via the ergenegon trials and arrests Erdogan now can control it. The new deep state reign retains all its business/legal and other societal channels and adding to that the part of society previously excluded or being kept under check the Islamist hopefuls. The presence of Grey Wolves in Syria’s Turkmen community (publicly giving interviews about the shooting down of the Russian pilot) reveals their role and even gives it a public role. In retrospect the Ankara bombings who targeted Kurdish democratic rallies with their high death toll, fits the profile of a Grey Wolves operation. It is alright for Erdogan to conveniently claim ‘it was ISIS’ and fit with West’s political hypocritical rhetoric about giving a damn for a problem they have created and sustain as a tool of furthering their influence and control in the region. The Ankara Bombing of Kurdish political wing by Turkey’s deep state (via Grey Wolves) is no different to them bombing the Kurds in Nothern Iraq overtly. Let’s not forget Grey Wolves attempted to kill Turgut Ozal Turkish Prime Minister in the 80’s so not only their ambitions, properly sheltered by the deep state, have no end, https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19880620&id=7TNAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=T1kMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5252,5375442&hl=en",2015-11-27 02:34:30,Emmy B

In North Africa and ME Arab Spring was followed by brutal repression and civil war aided by external military assistance either directly intervening (Libya/Syria/Yemeni/Bahrain) or tacit intervention (Egypt) via support for coups.

"@ WL you see now why Greece will never strike down a Turkish plane intentionally as a means of deterring Turkey to respect sovereignty? On the two occasions Greek pilots did so, it was due to being forced to down them in the air as they were dog fighting (i.e. an incident gone too far between pilots and military commands) Political leadership in Greece will never start a fight or war as they know since 1974 the US (and NATO) is supporting Turkey 150% and working with them in everything.",2015-12-07 06:44:50,Emmy B

"I’m doing a thing I’d like to share with you all… This year my school offered the partecipation in a project called NHSMUN (National High School Model United Nation), that is a big project initially created by IMUNA and organized by different associated orgs in each country (like Italian Diplomatic Academy in Italy). And this project practically gives students the possibility to take part in a course of geopolitics, international relations, diplomacy etc and at the end of it, they can to go to NYC, at the UN palace, to do a ‘simulation’ of work as delegates of various countries different from their own. In practice, students are assigned to a country, choose a Committee with two topics, follow the course and do research on the country and the topics, write a position paper and then go to NYC and debate with other students and do negotiations and in the end they prepare a ‘resolution’. This aims to help young people who want to become diplomats or something. Obviously I don’t want to be a diplomat AT ALL, but I decided to participate anyway because I think it would be interesting to directly experience ‘how things work’ in UN etc. A bit like ‘know the enemy’, lol. (joking!) The course started about a month ago and we already did various lessons on UN system and contemporary history (Cold War mostly). The history teacher was quite good, the other was strongly pro-USG instead (he supports TPP/TISA, loves Hillary and tried to deny the existence of WL docs on Saudi and UK plotting to be elected to UNHRC). But anyway, the course can still be interesting if you follow it with some critical mind. Anyway… today I was assigned to the country I have to represent, that is Ivory Coast. The Committee in which I’ll work is the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, and the two topics I will have to analyze as Ivory Coast ‘delegate’ are: 1) Palestinian Refugees in the Middle East, 2) Occupied Territories in Azerbaijan. So, that is, I just wanted to let you all know about this thing because I think it’s going to be interesting. I will share more about it! 🙂",2015-12-17 12:05:29,voidiss

These meetings two out of four extensive meetings in 4 months had as content terrorism as well as co-operation btw US/Greek SS. The curious thing is, if Cable is dated 25th of Feb how is it that it does not mention the terrorist activity against Minister Chrysochoidis on the 17th of Feb (a bomb exploded in his electoral centre by terrorist organisation Laiki Thelisi). Heh the Cable does mention though that on the 9th of Feb Bikas was appearing at a parliament to answer questions about the 2004/5 wiretapping scandal. (In retrospect, knowing from the Snowden revelations it was the NSA/CIA with the direct involvement of the US Embassy behind this scandal, I wonder how Spekhard felt been told by Bikas this titbit, maybe he thought it bad manners?)",2015-12-19 12:36:15,Emmy B

Fritz has a statement in the metro in Sweden. We can see no reference to SW saying anything there and are suspicious. There are three possibilities 1. UK journalists spun fritz to make it look like it was SW. 2. fritz egged them on to do that by making misleading statements or falsifications or SW told fritz “do whatever”. 3. fritz talked SW into the quote,2016-02-07 06:43:21,WikiLeaks
"But it’s important to tackle the SW falsehoods by going back to her original statements about being railroaded etc. The transition to the current claims can only be explained by duress (the ‘railroaded’ / police made it up / refusal to sign events) or by inducements. We haven’t wanted to push it for strategic reasons but there are SMSs that refer to borgstrom making cash inducements to SW that first week, where he says he’s brokering deals and SW bragging to a friend about how she can get cash.",2016-02-07 06:48:30,WikiLeaks

Focusing on ‘haters’, creating a scandal, contribute in massaging public opinion on how dangerous online hate speech is when right-wingers are involved, singing from the same song sheet that calls for censoring ‘insulting online speech’ after re-defining it as ‘violence online’ pushing public opinion in a certain direction.",2016-03-09 08:21:05,Emmy B

"*I know* i often thought during the public meeting I went to about the women (and the rest of the individuals) involved with the undercover agents how is it that for Example the Edward Snowden revelations of widespread surveillance or JA’s 24/7 surveillance or WL revelations about surveillance were never mentioned. To me it feels the same political issue of surveillance. The study the organisers did showed that this practice (agents sleeping with the objects of surveillance) went on continuously for a period of 30 years, ie, it proves we are not dealing with isolated cases of rogue agents but of a practice that was propagated by the state actors. One of the lawyers suggested to criminalise for agents to have sex with people they surveill. Still despite the public attention that has been created, the play, the book, the documentary, the public enquiry, why is it that such highly political issue as state surveillance has been kind of de-politicised via its personalisation. Yes, the women who exposed this practice did so in a personal capacity, yes, there might be as a result some responsibility apportioned, some compensation given but it seems to me this is an isolationist approach, a de-politicization, compartmentalised. At a time when in the UK there is the snoopers charter very much in the news, and there are campaigns via ngo’s civil society to push back, at the time when you have Jenny Jones scandalously been surveilled and lied on in FOI request for her files, time when Caroline Lucas legal action proved Wilson doctrine is a puff of air, time when JA surveilled 24/7 at enormous cost etc etc at the time when Trade Unionists expose and push back regarding blacklisting, why is it that all these matters are not unified under the same banner and find a loud political voice in Westminster. So yes, WL statement has various levels, 1. What does it take to create public opinion to react to the Fredriksson scandal? perhaps the personal drama of the women or men he was involved with sexually, even then it might be that society only sees the wrong in his conduct only under the prism of personal betrayal which they will describe as abuse. 2. What does it take for Swedish public opinion to see it is the Swedish state that is behaving in this manner, ie it is a political matter, that Fredriksson deceived, lied and manipulated because it was in his job description, he received a salary for it and he had a performance appraisal at the end of it, all paid for by the Swedish Taxpayer. 3. When does the Swedish public opinion define such behaviour as corruption, ie state surveilance, deception, manipulation is corruption, even in a ‘democracy’.",2016-03-09 08:49:35,Emmy B

"This kind of slow, silent expansionism that we see in the Aegan makes me think that ‘neutral zones’ have no chance of survival in this world, because the most powerful country in question would surely find a way to slowly overcome the ‘neutral’ barrier. When in NYC we were discussing about possible political solutions for the Israel-Palestine problem, someone in my committee came up and proposed to transform Jerusalem and a small area around it into ‘international zone’, therefore neutral and supervised by the UN. When he said that – even if the situation are different – this Turkey-Greece case popped up in my mind. I mean, here we see a ‘frontier zone’ between Turkey and Greece, but this frontier zone is blurred because of the presence of sea and various islands, so even if officially there’s an established sovereignty, it’s easy to create ‘grey zones’, make everything less fixed, and therefore giving Turkey possibility to expand without using violence, that would attract uncomfortable world’s attention. In the Israel-Palestine zone is pretty much the same: there have been episodes of intense violence, but the core of Israeli invasion is being made by slowly eroding Palestinian territories, by seizing metre after metre. And, well, it’s clear that this would happen in the case of a neutral zone too. Plus, if we consider that the external superpowers will help the powerful country in question (as NATO with Turkey, more or less), neutral zones can be nothing but facades.",2016-03-13 11:07:01,voidiss

No idea about China. in 1770 (read Orlof) Greeks handed it on the plate, no Russia took what they wanted from Turkey after encouraging insurgency and revolution in Greece as a distraction, then dropped Greeks like a hot potato. In 1917 lost in their own revolution Russia was the first to sign peace treaty with Ataturk prompting the other ‘great powers’ of the time to scram in competition with the other to sign peace treaties with Turkey leaving Greek army in the middle of Anatolia fighting alone, a complete defeat that led to the catastrophic Lozanne treaty of 1923. In Yalta, they sold off Greece outright to the West despite having a very loyal communist led national army on their side. That is why I don’t think they are serious. If only Russia had been more decisive in the Cyprus issue against Turkey perhaps they could have been taken seriously, who knows, but they didn’t.

We are watching what will Russia will do, will they be successful in getting the Kurds to sit around the table at the UN peace negotiations for Syria?

Crisis avoided for now. Junior gov partner ‘Independent Greeks’ convened a meeting and decided to support the government but they demand Refugee petty minister muzalas resignation over his error to call FYROM ‘Macedonia’ in public.,2016-03-17 08:43:00,Emmy B
"Everyone is calling FYROM Macedonia, he got carried away and made a simple mistake for which he has apologised. The problem is not so much the name but the irredentism coming from FYROM with territorial claims and rhetoric identical to the 1940’s Bulgarian Macedonian ‘state’ established by Burgaria in WWII. For those who do not know, Bulgaria was part of the Axis in WWII and one of the three occupying forces in Greece together with Italy and Germany. The Bulgarians were the worst of the three in occupying Greece because they materialised their strategic goal to access to the Aegean Archipelago. During the earlier 20th century Balkan Wars. Greece militarily defeated Bulgaria and so the newly liberated from Ottoman rule became part of Greece. Then there was an agreed exchange of population between Greece and Bulgaria as a means to bring ‘stability’ which happened. In WWII Bulgaria as part of axis took the opportunity to be extra brutal as part of ethnic cleansing efforts to annex the area for good. After the war they paid reparations to Greece. That is why the FYROM rhetoric is so difficult to accept. On the surface everyone is talking ‘what’s in a name?’ thinking Greece is unreasonable. But the issue is complex.",2016-03-17 09:01:33,Emmy B
"No one in Greece is challenging FYROM’s right to sovereignty self rule or borders. The collapse of the Iron curtain was looked favourably at home in the 90’s as finally Greece would be able to trade with its northern neighbours. No one anticipated the irredentism and nationalistic bravado of the past that had dominated early 20th century geopolitics and state formation would be coming back to life as a result of the breakdown of Yugoslavia. 2.5 million of its southern inhabitants declared self rule. Great but why would they chose to alienate 20% of its population that is Albanian (they are not Slavs) by identifying with the Greek Macedonian identity whilst they are not Greek. They claim ancient Macedon was not Greek as if the two are mutually exclusive, a historical ignorance of mammoth proportions “We call greek all those who share our culture” was the definition of Greeks in ancient time (common language, religion, traditions, trading relations) but that world had dozens of kingdoms, city states, islands without formal state structure. Some shared alliances and others fought bitter wars between them. Phillip of Macedon was the first with the ambition to unite all Greeks under his Kingdom and Alexander the Great realised this ambition then went on to conquer other territories, the rest is history. To conclude, you could be a Greek and not a Macedon (eg you could be a Thracian Greek like Thukididis or an Athenian Greek like Pericles, a Spartian Greek like Leonidas) but you could not be a Macedon without being Greek.",2016-03-17 09:34:43,Emmy B
"apologies for the long rants but you see it all ties in with the geopolitics of our era. I will put some links here in case anyone would like to read the issues. Could this issue bring down the government? Well I don’t think the minority party ‘Independent Greeks’ would make such a fuss if it was not important for their long term electoral survival. On the other hand it shows the pressures this government is under when practically nothing goes its way. If a simple error has led to such crisis, the writing is on the wall.",2016-03-17 09:43:33,Emmy B

A lot of ‘leaderless’ rhetoric is psycological cover for people who are very concerned about power gradients. This sensitivity to power can come from a desire not to be bossed around, but it can also come from another place. The first step to power is to stop others having power over you. The second step is to have power over others. In this case there are key assets such as twitter and the domain registration.

"He might have masterminded the suspension himself in order to protect his account from being ‘lost’. That is to say, if an account remains de-activated for certain amount of time then the handle becomes available again to be used by another user (you may not be aware but this is what happened to Christine Assange’s original account, when she abandoned it, it was eventually picked up by MGT or his friends and used as a harassing account, and it is now on my list of troll accounts recommended for blocking) By becoming suspended he is in permanent limbo, being inactive but without the risk of losing the handle.

"It has been done very carefully and accurately as far as I can see, the only thing I can raise, there is no culture of whistleblowing therefore, there is no word to describe whistleblowers, in the translation the word ‘informant’ is used which in Greek as well as in many other languages has negative connotations due to historic references, ie WWII etc.",2016-04-23 05:38:05,Emmy B

Greek Member of Parliament Papachristopoulos mentions the IMF WikiLeaks leak in a video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzK_7qJEywM,2016-05-05 07:51:48,Emmy B
"“What else could the government do” he says, “when it rolled out the dialigue with Thomsen and Mrs Velculesku, at this precise moment [the gov] fights the IMF tooth and nail, how would otherwise be able to ‘burn’ him” (he means discredit Thompsen).",2016-05-05 07:55:17,Emmy B
But the exact words do not mean admission the gov leaked the phonecall. It could very well mean that the gov chose to ‘adopt’ the leak and use it to the fullest rather than dismissing it and distancing itself from it as any previous government would have done.,2016-05-05 07:56:48,Emmy B

The Turks landed in Alexandroupolis helicopter Blackhawk, (photo from e-evros.gr) hoping that this will escape the consequences of their involvement in the attempted coup against Erdogan. The government spokeswoman Olga Gerovasili said that the eight arrested accused Turkey of violating the constitutional legitimacy and participation in coup aiming to overthrow democracy and hinted that it will be very difficult not to be extradited. She pointed out that all legal procedures will be adhered to but she stressed twice in a television interview in ERT that the offenses for which they are accused are very serious. The point is a hot potato. An and the decision seems to be one way. The Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was the first western politician who publicly backed Erdogan and even at the time when it was not clear which side would prevail in Turkey. It is rather difficult now to refuse extradition of eight Turks seven military and a civilian. But because in Turkey they have already begun to seriously discuss the imposition of the death penalty even for some of those involved in the coup attempt, there is an issue! The EU does not “cover” us to extradite defendants in countries that may condemn them to death.

"although he pushes that line Gulen=terrorist organisation etc etc perhaps the real danger to his power is the people closest to him within his party who perhaps wish to retain some of their power and see him as a liability. I have no idea if indeed Gulen had anything to do with the plot, or his sympathisers did, how could I, but Erdogan has marked them as his enemy and so it is. The Gulenist supporters sympathisers, if we believe the US embassy cables as an accurate source is into millions within Turkey, imagine how many have gone to the schools, have been in Gulenist trade associations or charities, Erdogan paints with the brush of terrorists a very large part of the population, it is extraordinary how he chose to act with purging thousands from positions of state, in the legal,judicial profession, the army, the police, kind of disintegrating the state and terrorising a huge part of the state apparatus and the population, introducing a chaos element within his own ranks. The enemy within, instead of ‘The Kurds’, ‘The Greeks’ ‘The Armenians’ ‘The Laz’ . I wonder how he can sustain this in the medium or long term. I get the feeling things are very much in flux. Neither can we assume that the external powers to be are currently idle. Considering the importance of Turkey militarily, Erdogan is now a liability for them too, I don’t know why Egypt comes to mind, perhaps because they were the only ones in UN not to condemn the coup attempt.",2016-07-18 09:04:42,Emmy B

"it is just the scale of Erdogan’s intention to criminalise potentially hundreds of thousand of people… on the other hand, Kurds have been at the receiving end of such discrimination for decades upon decades, previously Armenians, Greeks ethnically cleansed so society it seems is willing to accept such mass scale criminalisation of groups of people? but difficult to understand really what is happening. Trying to make parallels with other countries… de-baathification perhaps in Iraq, but it was done by an external occupying force, or the exclusion from power of Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt… but again it is different.",2016-07-18 09:17:06,Emmy B

Many took photos or short videos silently, many smiled back, some where happy to see our messages, others enquired with specific questions. One man working with the police (plain clothes) said we should not be protesting at the police as this had nothing to do with the police it was the prosecution who was responsible, I explained that it was Marianne Ny that chose the venue, this police station and that is why we were there, he seemed embarassed.",2016-09-08 14:11:57,Emmy B

If writers of articles are Trump supporters it makes sense to put a lot more in the story to put off Christian voters against Podesta. There is real deep fear for satan/occult practices (I am given talismans every time I go to Greece for perceived protection of me and the kids from the evil eye/satan and all sorts) among Christians as this is a major pre-occupation of organised religion.,2016-11-04 14:37:27,Emmy B

it is a can of worms as well as the stuff of comic strips,2016-11-04 14:52:40,Emmy B
Right. The term comes from persecuting people based on ridiculous notions. So the hypothesis that Podesta participated in Satanic rituals should not be pushed because it distracts from his actual corrupt practices.,2016-11-04 14:53:19,M
"I am not saying that Podesta did anything like that. Still, the fear is real among Christian communities since, let’s face it, organised religion has a lot of rituals that are controlled by priests but if they are performed by lay people, it is taboo, shocking. I am not familiar with the artist in question but the theme plays to the darkest fears and instincts of people.",2016-11-04 14:58:50,Emmy B

"PS in Greece, very much dominated by a Christian culture there are often scandals about satanists or occult practices, and people tremble. There is belief in the ‘evil eye’, reading the future in coffee cups, and sometimes one wonders where religion ends and magic begins as it gets blurry. 🙂 but in a set beliefs which accepts miracles and supernatural power like Christian communities do, there is also a recognition that evil powers exist represented by Satan, at a mild modern context the yin and yang but for organised church as well as people who believe, this is real. In our modern world we demand rationality above all in public office rather any sort of mumbo-jumbo although let’s not forget her ‘majesty the queen’ is also head of the church of England :-p for Podesta this story is bad news.",2016-11-04 15:10:25,Emmy B

"I know it is slightly off-topic here but Obama is to visit Athens this week possibly Monday the 14th. I read about what he will speak about, eg Turkey. The latter is very unstable, several politicians currently in gov and outside have been making bold declarations against Greek sovereignty derived by the 1923 Lausanne Treaty. Albania under Turkish influence has ripped up the naval border agreement with Greece and FYROMacedonia continues to propagate land claims over Greece in its constitution. US foreign policy has sadly favoured all adversaries of Greece. With Greece practically bankrupt, Troika still in control and Nato patrolling the Aegean for refugees, the situation is not ideal. That Obama chooses to visit is very curious to me. Their influence over IMF and Merkel regarding the debt and its forgiveness (not real forgiveness but a vehicle to manage it to allow some growth) is said to be Obama’s ‘gift’ A lot will be said about the visit, (he will also visit the island of Lesbos) this week, it is an opportunity to tweet WL’s most recent release about Greece and Cables full of the various national security problems described in them including Cyprus.",2016-11-12 14:02:39,Emmy B

Again there are plenty of WL Cables on the subject. These may be the issues in the news regarding his visit.",2016-11-12 14:18:21,Emmy B

"Mr Kurten suggests: “I may ask a further question asking what the Met is doing to ensure the safety and wellbeing of Mr. Assange and the other residents of the Embassy given the recent incident. I hope that these answers from the Mayor are useful.

Perhaps the question should fine-tune ‘wellbeing’ to include a question regarding access to appropriate medical care defined by JA’s published medical records?,2016-11-21 10:21:54,Emmy B
A different direction of questioning perhaps could include Mayor’s and Commissioner’s responsibilities for the safety and wellbeing of JA and Embassy people particularly in view of UNWGAD (Sadiq Khan has been a human rights lawyer) and as the most surveilled embassy in the world.,2016-11-21 10:26:33,Emmy B

"In the same post I have published a new question by David Kurten and an answer by the Mayor: Question: “Given the recent attempted break-in to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, how is the Metropolitan Police going to ensure the continued safety of Mr. Assange, who some would argue is effectively a political prisoner under house arrest? “Answer by the Mayor “ The Police are obliged to execute the European Arrest Warrant for Mr Assange and will do so should he choose to leave the Ecuadorean embassy. Regarding the attempted break-in at the Embassy, I am assured that the MPS continually assess the security arrangements of all diplomatic premises in London. Clearly, it would not be appropriate to detail these publicly.”",2016-12-06 03:15:38,Emmy B

This release will be revisited for many months to come, and as the different parts of the release go ahead interest will fluctuate but progressively increase, so plan B (old fashion technology for a back up recording of the press conference not a bad idea) JA is right that tech co’s and tech journals/journalists reporting on the matter tend to ignore the political aspect of the issue, and so the analysis provided by WL during the press conference, bringing everything together (technical, political, geopolitical, legal) it is of great value in sparking discussions. Also, perhaps consider, at a time when the release is a bit further down, a round table discussion post publication with small number of ppl reviewing the releases so far, not live (no avoid interference), pre-recorded but with the possibility of going over the material and reviewing its impact (Brexit Club style but only 30-60 min long) of course it is easy for me to say… anyways we continue to be amazed at WL efforts to prevail no matter what so keep it up <3",2017-03-24 08:14:18,Emmy B

"Millitaire.gr reports US Admin has requested extended military co-operation btw US GR with focus on upgrading military facilities in the AEGEAN in view of the (now agreed) all NATO offensive on ISIS. A US delegation will visit military facilities in the Aegean. In other articles notes that US interest has been up till now limited and focused on Greece’s Souda bay with developing US Naval facilities in Crete, now the focus will include other islands too, mentions Turkey’s unreliability as a partner for a reason, but of course I see an increased US military presence in the Aegean as strategically controlling the straights into Black see and the Russian fleet stationed there, perhaps limiting its involvement in Syria in support of Assad. Reminder that Nato has already been deployed in the Aegean ‘to control refugee flows from Turkey’ albeit obliged Turkey with avoiding South East part as Turkey claims should be de-militarised due to Lozane treatie and other accords (Greece has militarised parts of the aegean since the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus). Also reports US pressures GR to sign 5 yr rolling accord for the use of Suda to the annually re-newed agreement in place claiming this would allow them to invest further on their Naval base.",2017-05-24 21:43:17,Emmy B

Greece is a reluctant party and will resist its own military taking any part other than medical/humanitarian as it did in Iraq and Afghanistan but it’s proximity to the area and the use of it’s facilities clearly it involves the entire country in the adventurism perils of Western geopolitics. Trump’s Tomahokes (however you spell them) were anchored at Suda prior to deployment.,2017-05-24 21:51:55,Emmy B
"Britain’s divide and rule policy in Cyprus eloquently expressed in the 1960 terms of ‘independence’ (that truly never was) continued by US’s Kissinger endorsement and assistance in Turkey’s military invasion in 1974 (with signals assistance from US station in Crete and Israel’s signals too) leaves Greece with no doubt on how determined to harm, its ‘allies’ are. Particularly telling is that not once have either Nato nor US condemned Turkey’s daily air violations in the Aegean that have been forever increasing. As with geopolitics the big players like to have all options on the table.",2017-05-24 22:00:37,Emmy B

I have come across something strange perhaps WL needs to take a look. The BBC have changed the content of one of their articles completely from 29.05.2012 and recycling part of the content in a new article dated 19.05.2017 with the same URL as the old one. I found this as I attempted to archive the new article at archive.is and got the message that this url has already been archived. Why would the BBC do this? in effect the original article has now been censored. I saved the new article on wayback machine as not to interfere with the archive.is record.,2017-05-28 13:31:52,Emmy B

"Dear Emilia, Thanks for the update on the situation of Julian Assange. I’ll put these written questions to the Mayor in July; unfortunately the deadline for June questions has passed: Julian Assange (1) Now that Sweden has withdrawn its arrest warrant for Julian Assange, will the Metropolitan Police re-assign officers posted to watching the Ecuadorian Embassy to more important duties such as keeping the public safe from terrorists? Julian Assange (2) Will you lobby the government to overturn the arrest order from the Home Office for a minor breach of bail conditions in June 2012 so that taxpayers money can be spent on more useful policing operations? If you can think of any other points you would like to put to the Mayor regarding the Metropolitan Police please let me know.",2017-06-14 23:20:32,Emmy B

"In a way is indicative of the role some journalists play being the mouthpiece of government, especially when the government does not have the guts to speak plainly and truthfully about the motives of its actions. This is what the UK government has not the guts (so far) to say to its public and Roger Boyes seems to say it on their behalf: “Ecuador has to understand: it is not a friendly act to harbour someone who wants to drive a wedge between Britain and its primary ally.”",2017-06-21 05:26:42,Emmy B
But (The Times 17th Aug 2012) he had other advise to the British government albeit he is clearly on their side: “If Britain is seriously considering the physical eviction of Assange – with all the ensuing diplomatic risk – it can mean only that the British Government has come to share the US Administration’s view of the WikiLeaks founder as public enemy No 1. Is there an alternative line of action? Only this: to allow Assange virtual squatters rights in the Ecuadorean Embassy. Sooner or later Ecuador will change its president or simply grow bored with Assange. We could be in for the long haul rather than a dramatic dawn raid.” https://quakestudies.canterbury.ac.nz/store/download/part/275420,2017-06-21 05:36:18,Emmy B

"In Greece US secret services possibly with other collaborators planned an assassination plan (Pythia) against Right-Wing PM Kostas Karamanlis (it links with the 2004-2005 unlawful interception scandal – The Athens Affair) due to his re-approachment with Russia. Whether they intended to carry it out or they just did it to intimidate, we don’t know but it worked, he resigned after only 2 years in government. The following government of the ‘centre left’ PASOK headed by Clinton’s friend George Papandreou brought the Troika and IMF in spectacularly failing to manage the crisis and he resigned also after 2 years to hand over to a buraucratic coallition gov that lasted 9 months or so, then the right wing party of New Democracy headed by Samaras got elected, ex housemate of George Papandreou in US when they were both studying there, who also governed 2 and a half years till Syriza was elected in January 2015, then we had the ‘No’ referendum, then elections again in Sep 2015. Why I am saying all this? Yes the crisis and effective bankrupsy was the primary reason of the political instability but the complete failure of the political world to deal with the crisis, the rise of the Golden Dawn, points to an assault on democratic sovereignty that its beginning lies in US deep state destabilisation efforts during the Karamanlis government, first with the scandal of the unlawful interception of at least 150 people in government politics and the economy and then planning ‘Pythia’, at least as an assassination threat on Karamanlis if not the actual thing. With a country like Greece with fresh memories of brutal repression (Junta 67-74) etc etc, introducing such destabilisation is crippling to the political world as they do not have confidence they can actually govern the country. They did it with impunity to Greece why they won’t do it to America? Perhaps they always did it but were not found out, now everyone can see (not the details of it) but it is so obvious CIA and the rest of them meddle.",2017-07-11 14:22:01,Emmy B

There is an active warrant issued by Westminster Magistrate Court for failure to appear, and the MPS are obliged to execute it. This is an operational matter for the police who are continuing to review the situation.",2017-07-19 23:58:48,Emmy B
Answer 4 – The Mayor (13-Jul-2017) The MPS have not engaged any private police contractors operating in the surrounding streets of the Ecuadorian embassy. Organisations or communities may fund their own security patrols and the MPS will work with personnel in the most appropriate way to prevent and detect crime.,2017-07-19 23:59:30,Emmy B

"In the Aspen Security video that WikiLeaks shared today in its timeline, Pompeo mentions that the name of a CIA agent was published which he found unconscionable, to lukewarm applause, when the interviewer asked him ‘Do you talk about Phil Agee?” he says “Excuse me?” the interviewer repeats the name and Pompeo says “I’m sorry I don’t know that name”.

Well spotted. He is not referring to Agee but a NYT reporter.,2017-07-21 06:05:09,WikiLeaks
"Embarrassing I thought, some people laughed but probably because they knew who Phillip Agee was. I can understand that perhaps Pompeo was not on best form, but for sure that April speech was not written by him otherwise he would have immediately picked up on the name and say something ‘ no not him’ etc. The interviewer made references to his April speech about WikiLeaks earlier in this interview, so, Pompeo surely would have the April speech fresh in his mind, it did not happen a lifetime away. I guess someone else put Agee in there in the speech as a WikiLeaks/whistleblower equivalent from the past, from during the cold war when the trenches were clear cut and deep. And perhaps wanting to capitalise on Trump’s public opposition to Cuba. Trying to pass Trump & his supporters the message that “I love WikiLeaks” is certainly in the same category/trench as Cuban loving Agee. Who knows.",2017-07-21 06:16:33,Emmy B
