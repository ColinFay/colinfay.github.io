[2015-05-01 13:52:11] <noll> group Dm on Wls related trolls activity, incoming events & general topics.
[2015-05-01 13:53:39] <WikiLeaks> There’s a race on now to ‘spoil’ our new submission system beta.
[2015-05-01 13:55:02] <WikiLeaks> Greenberg, who palled up with the openleaks people, launched an attack on wired. Annoying if that framing starts to spread. Verge…
[2015-05-01 13:55:53] <WikiLeaks> ..stripped the hostility. We’re putting out a statement to soon. The interplay will be surprised by the election in the UK and the weekend.
[2015-05-01 13:56:03] <WikiLeaks> suppressed.
[2015-05-01 14:01:26] <noll> yes, both Wired & Verge contained DDB’s line of attack. how anyone could fall for OL says it all. expect submissions portal will face –
[2015-05-01 14:02:37] <noll> – cyber attacks. must be one of, if not the most scrutinized area of cyberspace atm.
[2015-05-01 14:03:55] <WikiLeaks> Greenberg is a partisan. Fraudulent to quote the narrative of such people without mentioning the OpenLeaks vaporware plot.
[2015-05-01 14:29:48] <noll> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/m_cetera/status/594197325729378304 the OL ‘quote’ manages to contradict itself w/i three lines. which seems indicative of DDB.
[2015-05-01 14:32:09] <WISE Up Action> Hi all. More comfortable discussing stuff in here to be honest.
[2015-05-01 14:37:33] <noll> hi Wise Up. good to see you. yep, agree.
[2015-05-01 14:40:49] <WikiLeaks> We will have a statement in 5mins
[2015-05-01 14:41:31] <WikiLeaks> The Next Web now is the most positive.
[2015-05-01 14:43:08] <WikiLeaks> @AnnieDarkhorse seems pretty reliable too
[2015-05-01 14:43:19] <LibertarianLibrarian> Glad to see all. I’ll pick up on the statement and RT. Hopefully, these attacks will fail spectacularly.
[2015-05-01 14:43:50] <noll> will add.
[2015-05-01 14:45:16] <WikiLeaks> @karwalski also
[2015-05-01 14:45:42] <LibertarianLibrarian> Agree re Annie. I’m corresponding with @voidiss, she’s solid adn enthusiastic, but she’s very young. Might let her keep picking up from me.
[DMConversationEntry] You added Matt Watt
[2015-05-01 14:47:22] <noll> we’re adding annie, & not much is happening..
[2015-05-01 14:48:41] <noll> Jen, agree.
[2015-05-01 14:52:46] <noll> Jen, could you try adding @AnnieDarkhorse?
[2015-05-01 15:07:29] <noll> any thoughts on whether @DouglasLucas would be interested?
[2015-05-01 15:11:02] <LibertarianLibrarian> I just tried to add Annie. Not sure if it did anything.
[2015-05-01 15:11:35] <WikiLeaks> See https://wikileaks.org/Some-notes-on-the-new-WikiLeaks.html
[2015-05-01 15:12:21] <noll> we’re seeing this at top of group Dm window: “Darkhorse could not be added”. we’ve sent Dm asking her to check Dm settings.
[2015-05-01 15:12:47] <noll> Wls, will tweet out.
[2015-05-01 15:13:33] <WikiLeaks> DL’s a great guy, but prefer not to have journalists here. Too tempting for them to turn such conversations into a story.
[2015-05-01 15:16:15] <WISE Up Action> Ok to invite ‘Wales’
[2015-05-01 15:23:44] <noll> understand. / Action, Wales is invited, go to ‘View people’ which is under the: … top right.
[2015-05-01 15:24:37] <WikiLeaks> What’s Wales?
[2015-05-01 15:25:25] <noll> @WISEUpWales
[2015-05-01 15:25:55] <WikiLeaks> Definitely.
[2015-05-01 15:27:18] <LibertarianLibrarian> Tweeted out on https://wikileaks.org/Some-notes-on-the-new-WikiLeaks.html
[2015-05-01 15:28:08] <WISE Up Action> H: ok cheers
[2015-05-01 15:28:21] <WISE Up Action> Night Jenny!
[2015-05-01 15:31:17] <noll> good night Jen :o)
[2015-05-01 15:51:46] <WikiLeaks> Someone tells us that DarkHorse doesn’t play with others, so perhaps not her.
[2015-05-01 15:56:59] <noll> understood, will drop it.
[2015-05-01 16:23:54] <Matt Watt> Hey, have shared the nextgen link. Assume this group is for distro of important links?
[2015-05-01 16:27:57] <WikiLeaks> Yes and advance notice of hostile twitter PR.
[2015-05-01 16:30:03] <Matt Watt> Ok sounds good.
[2015-05-01 16:49:45] <WikiLeaks> @SAWCSydney is also good
[2015-05-01 16:55:05] <noll> not sure we can add b/c they don’t follow us. can someone else?
[DMConversationEntry] M added SAWC Sydney
[2015-05-01 17:02:47] <Matt Watt> Sawcsydney is mainly automated tweets from their facebook page now, as is wikileaksparty. I will give Ian headsup re sawcsydney
[2015-05-01 17:11:03] <noll> http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-dea-is-coming-under-congressional-scrutiny-for-buying-hacking-toolshttps://www.wikileaks.org/the-spyfiles.html
[2015-05-01 17:38:50] <noll> re “more publications – free trade deals”, TPP already feature of Sanders/ Clinton race, would be great to nudge campaigns into citing Wls.
[2015-05-01 17:44:56] <WikiLeaks> We’re doing well with TPP in US.
[2015-05-01 17:45:12] <noll> also, great article by Kellie Tranter: http://kellietranter.com/2015/04/futility-regret/
[2015-05-01 17:48:57] <noll> yes. & looks like becoming major campaign issue w/ Clinton forced to follow Sanders lead “to neutralize him”: http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2015/5/1/pt_2_ralph_nader_on_bernie
[2015-05-01 17:50:25] <WikiLeaks> We don’t like tranter’s article, much. Poor rhetoric and all Assange traffic in the cables was moved to intel channels are a result of…
[2015-05-01 17:50:43] <WikiLeaks> …Dorlings constant FOIAs.
[2015-05-01 17:51:24] <WikiLeaks> It’s meant well, but she gives the enemies points, which there is no need to do, high up, then burries ours.
[2015-05-01 17:52:38] <WikiLeaks> e.g no need to faff about with grand jury to and fro. The US admits it, as of this year. End of argument.
[2015-05-01 17:53:44] <WikiLeaks> No need to go into muddying speculations about absense of evidence in Australian FOIAd cables. US admits it and recently.
[2015-05-01 17:54:36] <WikiLeaks> This ‘detailitis’ is a nasty disease that affects quite a few of our supporters and prevents them using the strongest point, straight up.
[2015-05-01 17:59:01] <noll> haha we thought ‘in case they leaked’. agree re Grand Jury, we love detail, but yep, it’s good to have the latest & strongest to hand, –
[2015-05-01 18:01:16] <noll> – speaking of which, last third of article implies Wls ended w/ Manning, rather than coming full circle, as seen today.
[2015-05-01 18:21:13] <noll> IoC’s Mapping Media Freedom including “cases of trolling & online abuse against journalists”: https://www.indexoncensorship.org/europes-journalists-face-growing-climate-of-fear/
[2015-05-01 18:32:26] <WikiLeaks> Yes. Committee to Project Journalsts (CPJ), which is HQ’d in NY, engages in detailing such horrors in Ecuador as cab drivers abusing…
[2015-05-01 18:33:03] <WikiLeaks> …journalists for being inaccurate sleaze bags thanks to Correa naming and shaming their articles.
[2015-05-01 18:34:39] <noll> sleaze bags – turn on Fox News & watch the ‘Mike’ interview.
[2015-05-01 18:36:28] <noll> think it’s reaching the end. on that basis CPJ should investigate Correspondents Dinner.
[2015-05-01 19:31:24] <noll> if this is end of cryptography, it’s getting closer: http://phys.org/news/2015-04-scientists-critical-quantum.html
[2015-05-02 05:52:25] <noll> Adrián Lamo posting random “this is not” legal advice for JA: https://www.quora.com/Is-the-House-Arrest-of-Wikileaks-founder-Julian-Assange-as-an-Unjust-Act/answer/Adri%C3%A1n-Lamo
[2015-05-02 06:03:26] <Emmy B> Yes saw it, thank you! not sure I’d like to engage with that horrid individual in twitter.
[2015-05-02 06:04:33] <Emmy B> Going to Brighton tomorrow, will watch that comedy, see what it is all about, sent tweets to artist and asked permission to distribute
[2015-05-02 06:05:22] <Emmy B> supportive flyers, he was most encouraging, let’s see… I hope it will be a positive show 🙂
[2015-05-02 06:16:53] <noll> some clips of his work. looks good & yep, likely to be positive.
[2015-05-02 06:21:28] <Emmy B> *excited*
[2015-05-02 06:54:04] <Emmy B> Reading above ‘detailitis’ LOL making up words 😀
[2015-05-02 07:00:05] <noll> Em, still traces of yahoo group where it was invented: https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:RZ9AF65-Ea8J:https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/CriticalChain/conversations/topics/5538+&cd=15&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk
[2015-05-02 07:06:32] <Emmy B> hahaha 🙂
[2015-05-02 07:07:14] <Emmy B> (let me not start on fwlf !!!)
[2015-05-02 08:16:12] <LibertarianLibrarian> Oh good grief, that WLF tweet is patently absurd. How can anyone take then seriously? I guess I constantly underestimate people’s stupidity.
[2015-05-02 08:16:30] <LibertarianLibrarian> Them
[2015-05-02 08:17:28] <LibertarianLibrarian> Enjoy the play, Emmy
[2015-05-02 08:19:08] <LibertarianLibrarian> Re Lamo, is anyone still talking or listening to that <bleep>?
[2015-05-02 08:20:36] <LibertarianLibrarian> Re the accusations about journalists in Ecuador, common attack, learned to ignore it. Correa is adored by his people & for good reason.
[2015-05-02 08:21:53] <LibertarianLibrarian> His division of media into private, public, state is very interesting. One thing I really like is that media corps can’t buy other business.
[2015-05-02 08:23:10] <LibertarianLibrarian> I’m a free market believer but we need media separate from those interests.
[2015-05-02 08:23:42] <LibertarianLibrarian> Hehe, we needed separation of press & state as well as separation of church & state.
[2015-05-02 08:25:17] <LibertarianLibrarian> Anyway, fascinated by what Correa’s doing in Ecuador.
[2015-05-02 09:09:53] <Emmy B> Been reading some Greek political articles also turn their eyes to Ecuador regarding restructuring media as well as the debt issue.
[2015-05-02 12:08:11] <WikiLeaks> It is a good time to spread Cameron, Osborne, Clegg, Milliband, Alex Salmond WL results. Try with “-stratfor” first
[2015-05-02 12:39:04] <noll> backup account still isn’t appearing in hashtags.
[2015-05-02 12:43:26] <noll> obviously stratfor flooding results is well know, is there no way to have it just show the end of email chains?
[2015-05-02 13:12:59] <WikiLeaks> No.
[2015-05-02 13:13:22] <WikiLeaks> You can sort by date, reverse, to send the end of the chain first in rhe results list, though.
[2015-05-02 13:54:38] <WISE Up Wales> Hi all. Can someone fill me in in 140 characters on the purpose of this group vs prev group and maybe benefits of this vs using IRC etc? Ta!
[2015-05-02 14:00:21] <noll> hi Wales, for various reasons prev group is not secure enough. re IRC, this is more convenient, & semi-protected by Twitters privacy rules.
[2015-05-02 14:12:27] <WISE Up Wales> OK, thanks H. Security issues were about who was on the list then?
Never quite know who you’re dealing with online I guess. I don’t, anyway!
[2015-05-02 15:09:15] <WikiLeaks> We can not assume that a twitter list is private. It’s more that there were a few trollish people on the previous list, which make
[2015-05-02 15:09:24] <WikiLeaks> having a useful conversation difficult.
[2015-05-02 15:34:56] <Emmy B> I appreciate having the list, I hope we can do better work supporting in twitter as a result.
[2015-05-02 15:35:13] <Emmy B> Goodnight everyone 🙂
[2015-05-02 16:43:45] <noll> [redacted ad hominem attack against an editor]

[2015-05-02 17:04:06] <noll> [redacted, third party information]

[2015-05-02 17:10:10] <noll> gossip columnist that can only see gossip, or same ‘nothing to see’ used on cablegate, whatever.
[2015-05-02 18:35:20] <WikiLeaks> Please see: https://twitter.com/wikileaks/with_replies
[2015-05-02 18:40:16] <noll> https://twitter.com/hazelpress/status/594677683696574464
[2015-05-02 19:24:31] <noll> looks like PR’s paycheck fishing, trying to draw CM into commenting.
[2015-05-03 00:14:41] <WISE Up Wales> Hmm, this is complicated, not least cos it’s not just artist [redacted, third party information] but also ‘the man behind the idea’ [redacted, third party information] http://anythingtosay.com/content/
[2015-05-03 00:18:57] <WikiLeaks> Their statement is that its from the moment of heroism, which makes sense, since no-one recognizes anything else.
[2015-05-03 00:18:57] <WISE Up Wales> and [redacted, third party information] statement on the website (& a later short description) refers to “Bradley Chelsea Manning” which is not the best.
[2015-05-03 00:19:24] <WikiLeaks> Yes. They should fix that.
[2015-05-03 00:20:13] <WikiLeaks> Although, if they want to tour the statue accross localities that are conservative, it makes sense to not draw attention to the sex issue.
[2015-05-03 00:20:20] <WISE Up Wales> They probably wanted to avoid the issue being diverted off into trans-politics – ie Manning is in jail for the leaks not for being trans…
[2015-05-03 00:21:00] <WISE Up Wales> but unless there’s some acknowledgement, that’s going to happen anyway, thanks to [redacted, third party information] and suchlike.
[2015-05-03 00:22:13] <WikiLeaks> They probably thought Bradley Chelsea Manning was a good way of getting the popular name in, and the new one, and not getting diverted.
[2015-05-03 00:22:55] <WikiLeaks> But that’s going to happen regardless thanks to statist fake radicals.
[2015-05-03 00:23:17] <WISE Up Wales> Using “Chelsea (formerly known as Bradley) Manning” would be improvement. I think all the media i/vs with artist he’s referred to Brad & he.
[2015-05-03 00:23:59] <WikiLeaks> Why do you say you think that?
[2015-05-03 00:24:14] <WikiLeaks> Is that based on recent interviews you have seen?
[2015-05-03 00:24:55] <WISE Up Wales> Because I’ve only seen a few interviews and those referred to Bradley and he. Don’t have TV, don’t watch a lot of vid of news reports
[2015-05-03 00:25:47] <WISE Up Wales> but hope I’m wrong! It’s a big and ongoing problem. Can’t even start having a conversation about Manning’s situation without getting into..
[2015-05-03 00:26:01] <WikiLeaks> The gender issue really is vulgar.
[2015-05-03 00:27:08] <WikiLeaks> 35 years in prison is just fine, provided CM can be called a ‘she’ by the guards. Horror.
[2015-05-03 00:27:36] <WISE Up Wales> …the trans issues immediately. It’s a societal problem, how we place so much importance on gender. I just do what I can with it as it is.
[2015-05-03 00:28:47] <WISE Up Wales> Gender identity politics is a nightmare. & a gift to the state, unfortunately.
[2015-05-03 00:29:28] <WikiLeaks> Yes. Gender essentialism is regressive.
[2015-05-03 00:30:58] <WikiLeaks> The whole fight was to liberate people from essentialism and understand that gender is a matrix of many biological signaling paths and..
[2015-05-03 00:32:14] <WikiLeaks> …behaviors, each of which can have different strength accross individuals and societies.
[2015-05-03 00:35:04] <WISE Up Wales> There’s no liberation where the fight’s ended up: now we’ve ‘the cotton ceiling’ where blokes who say they feel like they’re women…
[2015-05-03 00:35:21] <WISE Up Wales> …possibly only part time, complain that lesbians won’t have sex with them!
[2015-05-03 00:35:53] <WikiLeaks> To do away with binary ‘he’, ‘she’ as a stultifying simplfication and look at their unique values, skills and behaviors as an individual.
[2015-05-03 00:35:57] <WISE Up Wales> Meantime, many men are now afraid to enter social centres around UK for fear of being attacked for their behaviour
[2015-05-03 00:36:42] <WISE Up Wales> Yeah, a gender neutral pronoun would be v helpful.
[2015-05-03 00:37:53] <WikiLeaks> “the prisoner” has worked well for judges in our experience.
[2015-05-03 00:38:40] <WikiLeaks> “Bring the prisoner in”. “What do you have to say, prisoner?”, etc.
[2015-05-03 00:39:01] <M> FYI, ‘Anything to Say’ put out a statement re Manning portrayal on original kickstarter (at bottom) https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1856732911/anything-to-say-a-public-art-project-for-freedom/description
[2015-05-03 00:39:22] <WISE Up Wales> But we’re stuck with centuries of patriarchy too. The important thing is to build alliances between all those who are oppressed, not divide
[2015-05-03 00:40:27] <WikiLeaks> [redacted, third party information] A fake leftist, and a manipulative, predatory exhibitionist.
[2015-05-03 00:41:26] <WISE Up Wales> Indeed.
[2015-05-03 00:41:43] <WikiLeaks> Here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1856732911/anything-to-say-a-public-art-project-for-freedom/description#project_faq_113840
[2015-05-03 00:44:47] <WISE Up Wales> That statement is helpful (is that posted by Vaughan Smith?) but I can’t see anything like it on http://anythingtosay.com
[2015-05-03 00:46:50] <WISE Up Wales> ‘The prisoner’ can work but you can’t write long pieces or talk to people on the street for long in that vein. Also, in my experience…
[2015-05-03 00:47:36] <WISE Up Wales> …it’s important to clarify Chelsea/Bradley – you have to do it – or people think there are more than one person. Happened loads of times
[2015-05-03 00:48:34] <WISE Up Wales> I think it’s easy to forget when you know the story but many ppl simply don’t, or only sketchiest details
[2015-05-03 00:48:36] <WikiLeaks> We were being sarcastic with ‘The Prisoner’, pointing to this radical discovery of gender neutrality by hang’em’high judges.
[2015-05-03 00:48:43] <WISE Up Action> https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ao1yV7MGAnQ&feature=youtu.be
[2015-05-03 00:50:32] <WISE Up Wales> Sarcasm doesn’t travel easily on twitter! Or I’m slow! :o)
[2015-05-03 00:51:41] <WikiLeaks> Manning does have a Y chromosome and male genitalia. It’s anglo-centric to suggest that an Italian should move into the subjective frame.
[2015-05-03 00:52:18] <WikiLeaks> Doesn’t help with anglo-left audiences but it does demonstrate their provincialism.
[2015-05-03 00:54:20] <M> If Dormino had tried to create his own idea of what Manning would look as a female figure, he would have been attacked for that, too.
[2015-05-03 00:56:27] <WikiLeaks> Yes. And it would have turned off audiences in most countries.
[2015-05-03 00:57:56] <WikiLeaks> But they do need a little subpage to say how they’ve been in contact with the manning camp so people can shutup the idiots with it.
[2015-05-03 01:02:21] <WISE Up Action> Agree M and Wls
[2015-05-03 01:03:02] <M> Agreed. Preferably sooner so they can kick it in the can before people pick it up and make a big hubbub about it.
[2015-05-03 01:08:09] <WISE Up Action> Think it’s clear that the artwork is from a ‘historical’ perspective. Dormino shouldn’t need to explain, but if he did clarify this…
[2015-05-03 01:08:42] <WISE Up Action> Would nullify the gender debate
[2015-05-03 01:09:42] <WikiLeaks> The ‘historical’ aspect is explicity mentioned on the site.
[2015-05-03 01:10:03] <WISE Up Wales> “The sculpture will show Chelsea Manning at the time when the facts took place.
This is also motivated by the fact that the artist could not
[2015-05-03 01:10:15] <WISE Up Wales> get enough portraits of her actual look to make a realistic portrait.
All we are doing is to try and keep alive the public interest on this
[2015-05-03 01:10:31] <WISE Up Wales> story. The story of three courageous persons. One women and two men.” https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1856732911/anything-to-say-a-public-art-project-for-freedom/description
[2015-05-03 01:12:02] <WISE Up Wales> But the 2nd sentence is bullshit. ‘Actual look’ would be meaningless in the context of this sculpture.
[2015-05-03 01:13:25] <WISE Up Wales> Yeah, they could really do with the approval of CM to quote to detractors.
[2015-05-03 01:13:50] <WikiLeaks> Her ‘actual’ look is the same as the look of the statue, anyway.
[2015-05-03 01:15:57] <WikiLeaks> Did you notice @xychelsea dissing the Baltimore protesters?
[2015-05-03 01:16:38] <WikiLeaks> “I know deep down that this is not the answer #BaltimoreRiots”
[2015-05-03 01:17:42] <WikiLeaks> She’s going to have to be careful with this new public face. It may well be a mistake.
[2015-05-03 01:18:18] <M> I’ve been a bit disappointed by the feed. I think her articles are a lot more powerful/interesting than her twitter feed.
[2015-05-03 01:18:25] <WikiLeaks> Before everyone could project what they wanted onto her.
[2015-05-03 01:19:02] <M> And there’s been a lot of suspicion about the way the account is handled. She has confirmed it’s her, but re how tweets/replies are relayed.
[2015-05-03 01:19:50] <WikiLeaks> Yes. There’s likely some not altogether bright “PR advice” from Fitzgibbeon on the statements.
[2015-05-03 01:20:20] <WikiLeaks> The retweets are nearly all Fitzgibbon clients.
[2015-05-03 01:26:29] <WISE Up Action> G, yeah think they could lose that second sentence and the statement would be stronger. Would be enough to rebut criticism.
[2015-05-03 01:29:49] <WISE Up Action> Agree CM camp need to be careful with PR people coming in, picking up narrative.
[2015-05-03 02:15:46] <Emmy B> Ultimately a piece of art speaks by itself. Because it is public art it is there calling for discussion. The narrative ok could do with a
[2015-05-03 02:17:48] <Emmy B> little clarifying but essentially it is the piece of art that will speak by itself. Fascinating to read above perspectives 🙂
[2015-05-03 08:42:22] <noll> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/conniptions/status/594886880656793602 Agree w/ everyone’s points. thanks M, was looking for that last night. & yes, it could do w/ being on AtS website.
[2015-05-03 08:50:32] <noll> also, re CM’s TL, have to agree, it is awful – mostly b/c it’s completely soulless. if PR rather than accepting risk continues long-term, –
[2015-05-03 08:51:54] <noll> – it will hurt CM.
[2015-05-03 13:39:45] <Emmy B> Aidan is funny 🙂 he supports. Helped him distribute my flyers with his ads for next show, gave him lots more to distribute, he was very
[2015-05-03 13:41:58] <Emmy B> thankful, chatted after the show about details, he asked for more info to get it right, I will send links with info.
[2015-05-03 13:43:51] <Emmy B> the shows continue this week in Brighton, today about 30 ppl came filling the small venue, great atmosphere. He will do the show in London
[2015-05-03 13:45:38] <Emmy B> in July 20th, very keen to link up with supporters and improve the show. Wants to come Fri 19th July at special anniversary vigil. Leicester
[2015-05-03 13:49:47] <Emmy B> square theatre the next venue and in August Edinburgh festival.
[2015-05-03 14:27:06] <WISE Up Wales> Hi Emmy, glad this was worth the trip to Brighton. If show is good, maybe we should put dates/links on wiseup calendar?
[2015-05-03 15:10:48] <LibertarianLibrarian> Sorry I missed most of the above discussion until now. I agree with y’all, esp. what WL said about the gender representations.
[2015-05-03 15:11:45] <LibertarianLibrarian> Emmy, glad to hear the show ‘ s good. Wish I could afford another summer trip to London but can’t this year.
[2015-05-03 18:47:59] <noll> w/ re to catching show in Brighton, Killian: “you can book tickets to guarantee a place ( they are still free) but also it is a lunch time –
[2015-05-03 18:48:12] <noll> – show so u can probably walk in.”
[2015-05-03 18:54:21] <noll> DM on EAW: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3065507/I-framed-jailed-betrayed-British-tourist-tells-arrested-murder-Greece-held-squalid-prison-controversial-European-Arrest-Warrant.html
[2015-05-03 19:30:05] <noll> @TransTroops are trolling CM statue & Courage to Resist/ CM Defense Fund’s donation spend.
[2015-05-03 19:45:06] <M> 12 followers. Not really an issue.
[2015-05-03 20:37:49] <Emmy B> oh Aidan needs a new title for show for Edinb. Been told ‘saving Assange’ too much like ‘saving private ryan’ etc he was asking me for ideas
[2015-05-03 20:38:34] <Emmy B> (me? gig titles? LOL) any suggestions will pass on 🙂
[2015-05-03 20:50:28] <M> Not getting positive engagement or retweets. You can keep an eye on it, but not worth the effort because no effectiveness atm.
[2015-05-03 20:54:23] <Emmy B> I blocked them a few days ago but they persist, if they continue the same tune maybe I will add their name to the troll list?

[2015-05-03 20:58:04] <Emmy B> Morning all 🙂 @ H thax for link! interacted with Symeou back in Autumn when we were doing EAW twitter campaign, actively campaigns against
[2015-05-03 21:00:41] <Emmy B> I mentioned the very case to Aidan to demonstrate how unjust & distractive use of EAW is & made parallels with JAs case, will send link on.
[2015-05-03 21:02:25] <noll> Em, yes would do. / M, agree. think worth noting it’s there – seems similar to old prolific (now suspended) troll account: @ManningTrial
[2015-05-03 21:06:42] <Emmy B> @ g absolutely, I will ask for the details! (he offered free tickets to supporters) happy for us to distribute flyers etc at venue, also…
[2015-05-03 21:08:16] <Emmy B> he said we are most welcome to stand up say a few words at the end of the show so if you are around Sat 20th… 🙂
[2015-05-03 21:08:33] <Emmy B> *July*
[2015-05-03 21:10:04] <Emmy B> @ jenny <3
[2015-05-03 21:13:28] <noll> what about ‘Speak For Me’? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCgl6kC2ZTA
[2015-05-03 21:14:56] <Emmy B> goodnight 🙂
[2015-05-03 21:34:43] <LibertarianLibrarian> That sounds great Emmy!
[2015-05-03 21:36:21] <LibertarianLibrarian> Late, just dropped in, good night all. Tweeted the DM story. Wow, that’s horrific. And a good example of what JA is fighting.
[2015-05-03 21:54:35] <Emmy B> Thanks Jenny! Chortle has a review of the show
[2015-05-03 21:58:23] <Emmy B> http://www.chortle.co.uk/review/2015/05/03/22417/
[2015-05-03 21:59:11] <Emmy B> I sent an e-mail to Steve Bennett the author with request to kindly change the word charges, we have corresponded in the past, hopefully
[2015-05-03 21:59:21] <Emmy B> he will correct.
[2015-05-04 00:57:49] <WISE Up Wales> Killian is from Dublin where there’s lots of support. I’ve emailed our Irish list – includes actors/musicians who may know him already…
[2015-05-04 00:59:13] <WISE Up Wales> …or can make contact. Donal O’Kelly will be at Edinburgh Fringe too. Good to build links.
[2015-05-04 03:15:44] <Emmy B> Wonderful! 🙂 xx
[2015-05-04 04:30:44] <Emmy B> How lovely! just read Steve Bennett’s e-mail confirming that he amended his article, there is hope after all! Let’s keep trying! 🙂

[2015-05-04 05:11:52] <WISE Up Action> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/Amets4/status/595192958586134528 Anyone seen this?
[2015-05-04 05:12:33] <Emmy B> My comment on the Bennett article has been removed, a first!
[2015-05-04 05:14:55] <Emmy B> @ Wise Up , no reading now !
[2015-05-04 08:04:49] <noll> Em, what did your comment say? surprised BreeZee wasn’t censored: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/03/wikileaks-privacy-julian-assange-celebrity-scandal#comment-51442691
[2015-05-04 08:18:23] <Emmy B> nice one 😉
[2015-05-04 08:19:13] <Emmy B> well it is my first ever comment to be moderated out so I must have done something terribly wrong hahahaha
[2015-05-04 08:19:22] <Emmy B> three points:
[2015-05-04 08:22:14] <Emmy B> 1. her relationship with John Humphrys (mentioned here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Humphryshttp://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9309000/9309320.stm
[2015-05-04 08:23:05] <Emmy B> instead of conducting an interview to find out the truth he took it upon himself as part of the establishment to make JA a social pariah.
[2015-05-04 08:24:30] <Emmy B> could have lead to prejudice, evident from the arrogant disdain throughout her article.
[2015-05-04 08:26:42] <Emmy B> 2. claimed Sony e-mails are of employees engaging in sony economic activity, they are not personal e-mails. Mentioned the argument that some
[2015-05-04 08:28:11] <Emmy B> wish to see corporations get privacy rights as if they were individuals instead of being public institutions owned privately
[2015-05-04 08:28:23] <Emmy B> . Claimed she reflected this view
[2015-05-04 08:29:37] <Emmy B> 3. with regards to ‘they engage in gossip’ I said she shares views of others who claimed cablegate was libelous gossip, mentioned Erdogan
[2015-05-04 08:30:08] <Emmy B> of course and asked if she was comfortable sharing a chair at the same table as Erdogan.
[2015-05-04 08:31:49] <Emmy B> it doesn’t matter, I must have been rude without realising… but i have not kept copy so maybe I don’t recall everything correctly.
[2015-05-04 09:16:43] <LibertarianLibrarian> Oh, I doubt you were rude. I suspect they simply didn’t like what you said. Too bad you didn’t keep it. Could’ve blogged it & then we could
[2015-05-04 09:17:00] <LibertarianLibrarian> point out the Guardian’s hypocrisy in what they allow in their comments.
[2015-05-04 09:17:10] <LibertarianLibrarian> What you said all sounds rational and reasonable to me.
[2015-05-04 09:17:32] <LibertarianLibrarian> But congrats on getting banned by the guardian, I’d take that as an ironic compliment. LOL
[2015-05-04 09:17:55] <LibertarianLibrarian> not banned, but you know what I mean. Censored?
[2015-05-04 09:18:14] <Emmy B> oh Jenny 🙂 xxxx hahaha
[2015-05-04 09:19:30] <LibertarianLibrarian> Interesting tweet and article, Wiseup.
[2015-05-04 09:20:37] <LibertarianLibrarian> 🙂
[2015-05-04 10:28:21] <Emmy B> oh, Mr Humphrys won Sony award 2 years ago !!! http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10054738/Sony-Radio-Academy-Awards-2013-John-Humphrys-and-Five-Live-winners.html
[2015-05-05 09:17:49] <WikiLeaks> Great story on Marval CEO saying he doesn’t believe in female superhero’s to Sony CEO (because they don’t pay) out today form WL docs.
[2015-05-05 09:18:25] <WikiLeaks> Would be helpful to push this to feminists.
[2015-05-05 10:04:37] <Emmy B> They may be interested in updating their article: http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/why-is-theres-no-woman-lead-superheroes-in-marvel-films/story-e6frfmw0-1227319445070?from=public_rss
[2015-05-05 11:14:22] <noll> Marval CEO story fits well w/ ongoing Black Widow/ Joss Whedon ‘controversy’ https://twitter.com/search?q=joss%20whedon%20black%20widow&src=tyah
[2015-05-05 16:07:28] <WISE Up Action> FYI Re CM ‘approval’ for Davide Dormio statue as per previous discussion. It’s now up on CMSN which is some help http://www.chelseamanning.org/press/manning-assange-snowden-statue-unveiled-in-berlin
[2015-05-05 16:10:32] <WISE Up Action> I think the ‘image’ is totally appropriate (and anyway who’s to say it’s a ‘male’ image, just cos it’s short hair & tros!).But I’m gonna
[2015-05-05 16:14:23] <WISE Up Action> email them again about changing name & he to she.That’s a clear line that shouldn’t be ignored however off putting to some ppl it may be.
[2015-05-05 17:31:16] <LibertarianLibrarian> I agree about the image. Besides, it represents who she was when she took action as a whistleblower and when she stood trial. That’s part of
[2015-05-05 17:31:27] <LibertarianLibrarian> Who she is today.
[2015-05-05 17:33:22] <LibertarianLibrarian> This ‘argument’ over the statue title and gender image seems ridiculous at best & at worst an attempt to steal attention from the real
[2015-05-05 17:33:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> Purpose and message of the artwork.
[2015-05-05 17:35:42] <LibertarianLibrarian> I don’t like to see something that should be about human courage, integrity and truth be buried in an argument over how CM looks in it.
[2015-05-05 17:37:18] <LibertarianLibrarian> Most public photos of her are as the soldier in uniform.
[2015-05-05 17:38:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> There’s this ‘trans’ twitter account that has been attacking courage to resist, wondering if that’s a troll, not real.
[2015-05-05 17:51:38] <WISE Up Action> Maybe,dunno.It’s crap anyway. And the image is fine.I dont think the use of Bradley and he is OK tho.It’s a very simple matter to correct it
[2015-05-05 17:53:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, I agree re the use of ‘he’ and didn’t she legally change her name?
[2015-05-05 18:01:25] <LibertarianLibrarian> Regardless, she expressed her preference so that should be respected. But I think the artist meant well. It’s an adjustment, I occasionally
[2015-05-05 18:01:39] <LibertarianLibrarian> Forget and I try.
[2015-05-05 18:05:54] <WikiLeaks> Part of the problem is that the person at that time was also a ‘he’ and also called ‘bradley’.
[2015-05-05 18:06:49] <WISE Up Action> That’s totally understandable of course – we all do. And yes, she legally changed her name over a year ago. I have just emailed thanking
[2015-05-05 18:06:57] <WikiLeaks> There doesn’t seem to be a word, ‘heed’, representing a past tense form.
[2015-05-05 18:09:27] <WISE Up Action> them and linked to her request http://wiseupaction.info/chelsea-mannings-public-letter-coming-out-as-trans-august-2013/
[2015-05-05 18:09:41] <LibertarianLibrarian> The legal name change is a solid reason for using Chelsea. Perhaps ‘formerly Bradley’ might work – yes, we don’t really have good terms for
[2015-05-05 18:09:58] <LibertarianLibrarian> gender changes.
[2015-05-05 18:10:59] <LibertarianLibrarian> Or non-standard genders for that matter.
[2015-05-05 18:11:00] <WISE Up Action> won the world boxing heavyweight championship? the historical record is Mohammed Ali (Cassius Clay) not the other way round.
[2015-05-05 18:11:47] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, that makes sense and will very likely be the same for Chelsea.
[2015-05-05 18:12:03] <WikiLeaks> FYI: https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=transvestite%2Ctranssexual%2Ctransgender&year_start=1800&year_end=2005&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Ctransvestite%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Ctranssexual%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Ctransgender%3B%2Cc0
[2015-05-05 18:14:21] <LibertarianLibrarian> Interesting! A nice visualization of language evolving.
[2015-05-05 18:17:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> And that represents a change in society & culture too, though there will always be some resistance.
[2015-05-05 18:17:58] <WISE Up Action> Hah, well Chelsea prefers trans* (with a * OK?) It’s a fucking minefield!! Lucky I noticed before we publd this http://wiseupaction.info/about-chelsea-manning/
[2015-05-05 18:19:55] <WikiLeaks> It may have legal and financial consequences.
[2015-05-05 18:20:21] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yeah. I was just looking at medical terminology, represented by PubMed (Medline)’s medical subject headings. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/?term=Transgender
[2015-05-05 18:20:35] <WikiLeaks> There was a huge debate over the definition of ‘waterboarding’, which used to be defined as a torture technique. That fight is documented…
[2015-05-05 18:20:37] <WISE Up Action> it’s just a matter of doing our best like with anything. What may?
[2015-05-05 18:20:46] <WikiLeaks> …in the WikiPedia history for the term.
[2015-05-05 18:21:25] <WikiLeaks> Similarly, there’s has been a big fight on as to whether our staff are journalists and as to whether WL is a media organization, becuase..
[2015-05-05 18:21:36] <WikiLeaks> …it has legal and political consequences.
[2015-05-05 18:21:38] <LibertarianLibrarian> Transgender added in 2013, formerly transsexualism from 2001-2012.
[2015-05-05 18:23:59] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, and those consequences can be serious.
[2015-05-05 18:25:52] <M> Transvestite always referred to cross-dressing rather than living as non-birth sex, I think. Eddie Izzard still calls himself transvestite.
[2015-05-05 18:26:41] <WISE Up Action> Oh right. Well there’s a world standard/protocol for treatment etc http://www.wpath.org/site_page.cfm?pk_association_webpage_menu=1352&pk_association_webpage=3947
[2015-05-05 18:27:08] <M> There’s always Ed Wood’s 1953 classic, “Glen or Glenda”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vUoSPJm5w0
[2015-05-05 18:28:17] <LibertarianLibrarian> Re defining journalists, I think the world is changing faster than the old definitions can keep up with, and the ‘old guard’ is trying…
[2015-05-05 18:28:49] <LibertarianLibrarian> to hold onto what favors them, fighting inevitable change.
[2015-05-05 18:30:12] <LibertarianLibrarian> That’s true in a lot of areas today. My own field keeps playing with names, librarians, information specialists, informationists, etc.
[2015-05-05 18:31:25] <LibertarianLibrarian> When I was at Vanderbilt, it would change every couple of years. When I left, we were ‘knowledge management specialists’ or some such.
[2015-05-05 18:32:44] <LibertarianLibrarian> People have tremendous arguments over what we call ourselves, which I think is ridiculous, yet it does represent a massive shift in…
[2015-05-05 18:33:15] <LibertarianLibrarian> What we do and how we do it.
[2015-05-05 18:34:09] <LibertarianLibrarian> And if you don’t stay up with the changes you rapidly become obsolete.
[2015-05-05 18:34:55] <WikiLeaks> People should call themselves ‘obsoletists’ and be done with it.
[2015-05-05 18:35:37] <LibertarianLibrarian> I think that’s the same underlying fear of ‘traditionalists’ looking at new forms of journalism and media like Wikileaks and others.
[2015-05-05 18:36:16] <LibertarianLibrarian> LOL! Yes, that’s exactly what they are! And what they’re afraid of.
[2015-05-05 18:36:24] <WikiLeaks> There just a bunch of finks trying to protect their turf.
[2015-05-05 18:37:43] <WikiLeaks> Really, we’ve never encounted a profession with such responsibility and such incompetence. Each day they fly jumbo jets filled with entire..
[2015-05-05 18:38:17] <LibertarianLibrarian> Exactly. I see so much of that in academia. The territoriality and inflated egos are incredible.
[2015-05-05 18:39:10] <WikiLeaks> ..nations. And each day they manoever according to whim, petty personal vendettas, sucking up or because they can’t be arsed.
[2015-05-05 18:39:44] <WikiLeaks> There’s more deaths on the average journalists head than the average soldier, by a factor of a 100.
[2015-05-05 18:41:20] <LibertarianLibrarian> I wouldn’t doubt that. I was just complaining earlier today how giving a previously intelligent woman the title of ‘Dean’…
[2015-05-05 18:41:56] <LibertarianLibrarian> Resulted in immediate deletion of brain function while simultaneously inflating the ego beyond proportion
[2015-05-05 18:42:19] <WikiLeaks> If you want to see who someone really is, give them power.
[2015-05-05 18:43:10] <WikiLeaks> There’s a half dozen decent national security journalists in english, who the other 10,000 journalists in english detest.
[2015-05-05 18:43:47] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/FOIcentric/status/595764373903286272 This was just tweeted, but I can’t get the link to open:
[2015-05-05 18:44:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, sadly very true. Seen it happen close up.
[2015-05-05 18:44:46] <WISE Up Action> So agree. The power and abnegation of responsibility of media is so damaging. Imagine the good that could be done! It’s so depressing
[2015-05-05 18:45:32] <WikiLeaks> Facebook have now directly intervened in the UK election. A sign of things to come.
[2015-05-05 18:47:12] <LibertarianLibrarian> Interesting link, M.
[2015-05-05 18:47:54] <WISE Up Action> It’s opened for me, M.
[2015-05-05 18:48:44] <LibertarianLibrarian> Seriously? Facebook is so dangerous. I’m glad I got off it.
[2015-05-05 18:49:56] <LibertarianLibrarian> I tell people I am boycotting it for ethical reasons. Most agree but then say they’re using it anyway b/c family or friends are.
[2015-05-05 18:52:22] <M> PDF: New FOI document re WL, TPP, WaPo article saying US will not charge JA http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/corporate/freedom-of-information/Documents/dfat-foi-13-19105.pdf
[2015-05-05 18:54:37] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes. Not as much there as I expected but it does include the TPP environmental Chpt release

[2015-05-05 18:56:59] <LibertarianLibrarian> The highly redacted bit on the HOM interview is interesting, though.
[2015-05-05 19:54:35] <noll> M, is this the link? http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/corporate/freedom-of-information/Documents/dfat-foi-15-792.pdf
[2015-05-05 20:07:22] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, that’s it.
[2015-05-05 20:07:25] <noll> interesting comments by US Head of Mission https://archive.is/04ahQ#selection-1149.0-1271.98
[2015-05-05 20:07:57] <LibertarianLibrarian> I agree. I’d love to see the redacted parts of that.
[2015-05-05 20:09:37] <LibertarianLibrarian> *totally off topic* But just have to say that having my heart monitor broadcasting over AT&T to some medical co in another state is creepy!
[2015-05-05 20:11:04] <LibertarianLibrarian> HIPAA protections my ass. This is probably totally unprotected & hackable, & the fact no one could care less about my irregular heartbeat is
[2015-05-05 20:11:09] <LibertarianLibrarian> Irrelevant.
[2015-05-05 20:12:29] <LibertarianLibrarian> Freaky.
[2015-05-05 20:12:52] <LibertarianLibrarian> *interruption over*
[2015-05-05 20:20:27] <noll> HIPAA exemptions (usual cover-all..): https://www.eff.org/issues/national-security-and-medical-information
[2015-05-05 20:32:46] <noll> another take re Wls comments on armchair stenographer/ war: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispatches_(book)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeehkdQL_VE
[2015-05-06 01:33:27] <Emmy B> Re: Hipaa exceptions, what a nightmare.
[2015-05-06 01:51:59] <Emmy B> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando:_A_Biography
[2015-05-06 05:37:31] <LibertarianLibrarian> Oh, thanks, I really need to look over those exceptions… what a nightmare!
[2015-05-06 05:39:20] <LibertarianLibrarian> I’m getting really, truly sick of ‘National security’ as an excuse for violating our rights and liberties. It’s gone insane!
[2015-05-06 08:28:56] <noll> as politicians get nervous over gaining/ retaining seats, now is good time to flag UK/ election centric cables.
[2015-05-06 09:12:22] <noll> has anyone else been blocked by Steinitz? https://archive.is/O8qNV#selection-937.83-937.111
[2015-05-06 09:26:33] <WISE Up Action> Yep, still blocked
[2015-05-06 09:42:38] <Emmy B> I don’t think I am, I can view her profile and her photo stream with no problem.
[2015-05-06 09:43:09] <Emmy B> I just realised that Anke has three accounts not just one: https://archive.is/gx0Cs

@opengovme
[2015-05-06 09:45:21] <Emmy B> Yes you are right, I just noticed.
[2015-05-06 09:46:11] <Emmy B> I just mention this here, in case @ h wishes to check steinitz interaction with those accounts.
[2015-05-06 10:11:52] <noll> Em, will look through them, & document anything interesting.
[2015-05-06 12:17:34] <M> Feminist activists went and put a wig on Manning statue and spraypainted a trans logo near/on the display. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvIdSGL8Ifo
[2015-05-06 12:24:17] <noll> & they didn’t spray-paint ‘rapist’ etc on JA statue, hard to think of more compelling sign of Sweden’s snowballing PR failure.
[2015-05-06 12:27:37] <M> Heh, apparently JA is now considered a “famous Londoner”. http://32londoners.com/jassange.html
[2015-05-06 12:28:03] <WISE Up Action> Doesn’t look as though its damaged, which is good.
[2015-05-06 12:31:15] <WISE Up Action> It really pisses me off that the message on protesting the image is that girlie’s must have long hair ffs
[2015-05-06 12:37:23] <WISE Up Action> wtf is that about?! How is it ‘male’? We females not allowed to wear trousers now, huh?
[2015-05-06 12:50:56] <Emmy B> http://femmefoebia.tumblr.com/
[2015-05-06 12:53:56] <Emmy B> Not quite the same as pulling down the swastiga from the Acropolis, now, is it?
[2015-05-06 12:54:26] <M> The statement is ridiculous.”This is a typical act of ‘daddy knows best’ male supremacy”, etc. I hadn’t realized they glued the wig on.
[2015-05-06 12:55:30] <Emmy B> some may see this action as kind of putting the david’s star on the new Jew, opening the way for the real trans/homo-phobes to bully Chelsea
[2015-05-06 13:01:04] <Emmy B> very selfish
[2015-05-06 13:09:22] <noll> M, MacFadyen was certainly improvement – imagine David Leigh screeching about JA to hapless tourists 30 mins..
[2015-05-06 13:12:55] <WISE Up Action> Oh H lay off with the nightmares x
[2015-05-06 13:16:12] <Emmy B> hehehe can’t fit into anything decent… will be giving the reception a miss 😉
[2015-05-06 13:24:33] <noll> when did feminism fall to empty posers.. https://twitter.com/hazelpress/status/596046262186745857https://archive.is/hjLvx
[2015-05-06 13:28:00] <WISE Up Action> Precisely. A Barbie wig indeed. How much do we want to promote them, though? How much is it circulating w/o us? Shld we ignore? Or not?
[2015-05-06 13:32:13] <noll> should we ignore? / & why a Barbie wig – b/c group is likely fake – first post “May 3rd, 2015” http://femmefoebia.tumblr.com/post/118036880894/101
[2015-05-06 13:34:05] <Emmy B> This action is grotesque I would not call them feminists.
[2015-05-06 13:34:42] <Emmy B> Only the trolls will jump on this.
[2015-05-06 13:37:12] <Emmy B> there is another aspect to this too. Do all trans* ppl have to be ‘outed’ as such? only the person involved has the right to define/declare
[2015-05-06 13:37:31] <Emmy B> express what they are.
[2015-05-06 13:38:24] <Emmy B> this artistic expression (statue) does not represent CM as a person as much as an idea due to her action, which is for what she will be
[2015-05-06 13:38:39] <noll> – we’re not sure how to respond. / Em, group has ‘existed’ for *three days via few random fem’ posts. & now this. it’s not authentic.
[2015-05-06 13:38:52] <Emmy B> remembered.
[2015-05-06 13:39:13] <Emmy B> Well, if this is the case, we should take a look at them.
[2015-05-06 13:39:23] <Emmy B> thanks!
[2015-05-06 13:40:27] <WISE Up Action> Well that’s true Emmy, but she has come out. And I think it’s both but the person is integral to the idea you speak of.
[2015-05-06 13:41:08] <noll> no fem’ group serious enough to take that action would make Barbie mistake, or post such obviously contrived material.
[2015-05-06 13:42:14] <WikiLeaks> The statue is a success. It’s pictures are everywhere. The idiots will be seen as such.
[2015-05-06 13:42:41] <noll> – going back to your comments, – we expect CM is very proud of who she was during that time. & others should be to.
[2015-05-06 13:43:38] <Emmy B> @ h Buzfeed and gawker posts, could it be these ppl are not German but American? why use US publications?
[2015-05-06 13:49:30] <Emmy B> Strange spellings of phobia as ‘foebia’ in the domain name, what language is that? German?
[2015-05-06 13:50:46] <Emmy B> ah! probably word play with Foe, I see…
[2015-05-06 13:55:37] <WISE Up Action> This is the letter we sent earlier http://wiseupaction.info/letter/
[2015-05-06 13:56:28] <WISE Up Action> now replied affirming.
[2015-05-06 14:00:01] <WikiLeaks> Sorry–who replied affirming what?
[2015-05-06 14:00:23] <WikiLeaks> Also, who wrote the excellent, long, recent wiseup text re: Manning?
[2015-05-06 14:01:05] <noll> Wls, perhaps. it’s not likely to excite serious fem/ trans activists, but then they’re not ones jumping up & down in limelight.
[2015-05-06 14:01:41] <WISE Up Action> Chelsea Manning Support Network. And that they agreed with the request and how it was formulated. Hah! Me We’re making an attempt to update
[2015-05-06 14:03:01] <noll> Em, agree, dressed up as anarchists posting buzzfeed.. it’s laughable.
[2015-05-06 14:04:07] <WISE Up Action> the whole site.So that will become a sep heading ‘Chelsea Manning’ on the menu. Other headings still to be written up ‘JA’ ‘The Docs’ etc
[2015-05-06 14:08:58] <WikiLeaks> Yes. The German trans* activists are probably a CIA first mission test.
[2015-05-06 14:09:22] <WikiLeaks> Do you know who wrote it at CMSN?
[2015-05-06 14:13:12] <WikiLeaks> Their prose is not usually so good.
[2015-05-06 14:14:50] <WISE Up Action> Wrote what? D’you mean their write up on their website http://www.chelseamanning.org/press/manning-assange-snowden-statue-unveiled-in-berlin
[2015-05-06 14:15:38] <Emmy B> Lindi wrote the wise up article, dah!
[2015-05-06 14:16:51] <Emmy B> As usual, her language is amazing <3
[2015-05-06 14:19:52] <WISE Up Action> Cheers, Em! Yes, I wrote http://wiseupaction.info/about-chelsea-manning/
[2015-05-06 14:22:14] <WikiLeaks> We meant this: http://wiseupaction.info/about-chelsea-manning/
[2015-05-06 14:22:19] <WikiLeaks> It’s excellent.
[2015-05-06 14:23:10] <WikiLeaks> The best thing we’ve seen, actually.
[2015-05-06 14:23:18] <WikiLeaks> [on Manning]

[2015-05-06 14:25:01] <WikiLeaks> Although we’re proud of this, too: https://wikileaks.org/Assange-Statement-on-the-First-Day.html
[2015-05-06 14:26:19] <Emmy B> 🙂
[2015-05-06 14:29:17] <WISE Up Action> Oh praise indeed. TYVM. I have concentrated on following the case closely as I can.Good old Alexa.And there is a link to yr statement in it.
[2015-05-06 14:31:10] <Emmy B> Maybe should be the basis for a new flyer? ready for London Pride?
[2015-05-06 14:37:40] <WISE Up Action> which we also thought singular (it’s under Court Martial heading) and have had on home page since it was pub’d…
Yes, maybe we do need
[2015-05-06 14:37:48] <WikiLeaks> It’s very clear, but still covers a lot of detail, that’s a hard combination.
[2015-05-06 14:37:59] <WISE Up Action> new flyer.
[2015-05-06 14:47:01] <WISE Up Action> I felt there was not a lot out there that was comprehensive & interesting so spent a lot of time on it.Very glad indeed you all like it! TY
[2015-05-06 14:47:53] <Emmy B> I think it would be a wonderful content for a new flyer in addition to the excellent we still have and we can take the opportunity to update
[2015-05-06 14:48:01] <Emmy B> the photo to how CM wishes to be depicted 🙂
[2015-05-06 15:09:33] <Emmy B> Thanks for the Re-tweets from WiseUp Blog WL 🙂 Good Night all! x
[2015-05-06 15:10:45] <noll> night Em :o) x
[2015-05-06 15:22:19] <M> Channel 4 has comedy programme “Bugsplat” which apparently parodies Collateral Murder http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/tv-radio/tv-review-bugsplat.1430949340
[2015-05-06 16:52:58] <Bean> did someone say ‘flyer’? email me if you would like a hand 🙂
[2015-05-06 23:41:30] <Emmy B> Beanyyyy! <3
[2015-05-06 23:52:44] <Bean> yes am here lurking in the background! <3
[2015-05-06 23:54:02] <Emmy B> 😀
[2015-05-06 23:57:19] <Emmy B> Thank you for your kind offer, I will speak to Lindi about a new flyer for CM and we are coming up to the 3rd Embassy Anniv. so I’d like to
[2015-05-06 23:59:11] <Emmy B> Ask for an update to our Sun or Cell flyer cover pls to ‘3 years’ http://greekemmy.com/2015/03/13/with-many-thanks-to-somersetbean-for-an-amazing-assange-infographic-here-is-a-flyer/
[2015-05-07 00:00:16] <Bean> yes great – no worries…
[2015-05-07 00:00:35] <Bean> also… bean will be lurking indefinitely in the uk from july so look forward to catching up with y’all over time 🙂
[2015-05-07 00:02:37] <Emmy B> omg – fantastic!!!! really looking forward it 🙂 catch up with you later *dashing- schoolrun*
[2015-05-07 00:04:13] <Bean> 🙂
[DMConversationEntry] WISE Up Action changed the group name to hazelpress + 9
[2015-05-07 06:44:35] <WISE Up Action> apparently I ‘changed the group name to hazelpress + 9’.It’s unintentional.Don’t know what I did or what it was before.Sorry. Am technodiv
[DMConversationEntry] You changed the group name to wikileaks + 10
[2015-05-07 06:57:27] <noll> well.. ‘my first CIA operation’ sure made an impact: https://twitter.com/FEMMEFOEBIA
[2015-05-07 07:02:27] <WikiLeaks> The statue has already established its own credibility. They’ll need a much sexier operation than that to ruin it.
[2015-05-07 07:33:51] <noll> perhaps MI5 trainees can do better, unlikely / if schedule allows, this could be good moment to bring AtS to UK: https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/stand-up-for-truth-whistleblowers-speaking-tour-london-tickets-16772291375
[2015-05-07 07:51:50] <noll> of interest: http://www.deepfreeze.it/article.php?a=gjp
[2015-05-07 08:03:35] <noll> another perfect rely by Greenwald: https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/596310063947583488
[2015-05-07 08:59:46] <Emmy B> What does AtS stand for?
[2015-05-07 09:00:50] <noll> Anything to Say
[2015-05-07 09:03:02] <Emmy B> of course! ::-)
[2015-05-07 09:03:58] <Emmy B> I think Paris might be next on schedule 🙂
[2015-05-07 09:23:37] <Emmy B> http://www.chelseamanning.org/featured/nifspa
[2015-05-07 12:08:46] <LibertarianLibrarian> Great stuff! I get stuck in work and in a doctor’s office and cool stuff happens out here. But I’m being sent home so can catch up soon. 🙂
[2015-05-07 12:09:47] <LibertarianLibrarian> I think ignoring those idiots is best. No one is going to take seriously someone stupid enough to use a Barbie wig to deface art.
[2015-05-07 12:10:23] <LibertarianLibrarian> Congrats Lindi on the article.
[2015-05-07 12:12:20] <Emmy B> Agree, excellent point!
[2015-05-07 14:02:53] <noll> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/BBCBreaking/status/596419343254167554 bbc one – “remarkable”, “sensational”
[2015-05-07 14:13:30] <WikiLeaks> That’s a major turn around compared to polling.
[2015-05-07 14:16:30] <noll> yes! surprising, looks like we’re staying up. Greens + 1 :o) Lib Dems.. haha / Em, was only one Steinitz/ Anke: https://archive.is/Ysrgu
[2015-05-07 14:18:01] <WikiLeaks> We’d guess that the exit poll is flawed, but it’s also possible that today’s front pages + Torygraph emails shifted results.
[2015-05-07 14:19:39] <Emmy B> thx H! I don’t understand UK pol in the least!
[2015-05-07 14:19:58] <WikiLeaks> Cameron is now 1/7 to be next PM for bookmakers. The smart money is on the Tories now.
[2015-05-07 14:22:07] <noll> 2010’s exit was close to dead on: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2010_United_Kingdom_general_election#Exit_poll
[2015-05-07 14:30:15] <noll> – but that only goes so far, labour’s front bench has no weight to it, & major figures like ed balls/ miliband don’t cut it at all.
[2015-05-07 14:31:41] <WikiLeaks> Yes. That’s well known.
[2015-05-07 15:30:01] <LibertarianLibrarian> At least they have some slight variations in their parties and more than 2 potential options. I don’t know the UK parties well, but it’s
[2015-05-07 15:30:06] <LibertarianLibrarian> Interesting
[2015-05-07 15:31:12] <LibertarianLibrarian> Somehow my country has to find a way out of this ‘2 party’ system which has devolved into evil #1 vs evil #2 & there’s no real diff.
[2015-05-07 15:57:15] <noll> SNP advance is stunning. since indyref London establishment has seemed set on federal UK, b/c after all, anything less is lost.
[2015-05-07 16:13:02] <noll> Jen. there’s also no substantial diff’ here – labour tends feed fatcats & undo minimalist socialism w/ jawdropping economic incompetence.
[2015-05-07 16:58:06] <noll> if conservative largest party, labour largest coalition? – media could effectively decide this.
[2015-05-07 17:42:06] <LibertarianLibrarian> Guess I don’t know the parties well enough. Just seems like there’s more variety with Tories, Conservatives, Labour, Greens.
[2015-05-07 17:43:33] <LibertarianLibrarian> Well, we technically have a Green party in some places, I think. Really, the only semi-viable 3rd party is Libertarians & I vote 4 them.
[2015-05-07 17:45:14] <LibertarianLibrarian> Not that it’s done much good.
[2015-05-07 17:48:01] <noll> Andrew Marr – ultimate establishment journo is now forecasting federalism via bbc. / Jen, have to go back to 1908: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_governments
[2015-05-07 17:51:55] <noll> – for last time 3rd party (Liberals) formed govt. but things looking interesting for future, & soon climate change w/ become huge factor.
[2015-05-07 17:54:34] <Bean> had a laugh at this…guardian asks ‘what went wrong with the polls?’ not ‘ what went wrong with labour… and our politics?’ !!
[2015-05-07 17:54:37] <Bean> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaxz6c-qXM4
[2015-05-07 17:56:38] <LibertarianLibrarian> LOL!
[2015-05-07 18:02:07] <noll> haha JB looks close to tears! wonder what he was hoping for (for himself) over next 5 years.
[2015-05-07 18:19:48] <noll> labourites now blaming media bias – but it’s a chicken & egg thing: leadership/ policies, could have followed SNP ‘social’ platform which –
[2015-05-07 18:22:22] <LibertarianLibrarian> It’s clear the Scottish independence movement isn’t finished by a long shot.
[2015-05-07 18:22:40] <noll> – powered past media. or, looked ahead & elected David Miliband & gone Blair 2.0. as it is we’ve literally already forgotten their campaign.
[2015-05-07 18:31:55] <noll> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/MurtazaGeoNews/status/596475088364503040 looks like Wls ally George Galloway is out.
[2015-05-07 18:34:30] <noll> Jen, Marr has been very well briefed by Whitehall, stating SNP is “unstoppable” & Cameron will lead last UK ‘as we know it’ govt.
[2015-05-07 18:52:30] <LibertarianLibrarian> Galloway seemed like a cool guy, or at least independent and unique. And always sad to see a WL supporter go out
[2015-05-07 18:56:16] <LibertarianLibrarian> That’s very interesting re the SNP. Definitely worth watching. There was likely to be a backlash given the closeness of the referendum…
[2015-05-07 18:56:32] <noll> labour campaign in GGalloway’s constituency was in complete disarray, but then they got it together & GG responded w/ v. negative campaign.
[2015-05-07 18:57:31] <LibertarianLibrarian> Oh, yeah, voters get sick of those kinds of campaigns. Not the best tactic.
[2015-05-07 18:59:16] <WISE Up Action> Maybe SNP anti-austerity,anti-trident etc message winning so dramatically will have impact widening the parties, forcing some change
[2015-05-07 19:00:51] <LibertarianLibrarian> There will have to be some adjustments made in response to big SNP win. They have certainly made a statement.
[2015-05-07 19:02:39] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, GG is one of the few British politicians I’ve heard of, so he was a strong voice.
[2015-05-07 19:04:27] <noll> Jen, agree re GG. / Action, agree, if only labour had followed policies w/ decent front bench, & greens had CL leading.
[2015-05-07 19:04:53] <LibertarianLibrarian> Who’s CL?
[2015-05-07 19:05:52] <noll> Caroline Lucas – https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Lucas
[2015-05-07 19:08:38] <LibertarianLibrarian> Thanks. Her name’s faintly familiar – seen her mentioned on Twitter. Good to know.
[2015-05-07 19:09:55] <noll> she was leader of Greens, replaced by: http://www.lbc.co.uk/incredibly-awkward-interview-with-natalie-bennett-105384
[2015-05-07 19:10:45] <noll> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/nickdearden75/status/596496917145767936
[2015-05-07 19:12:17] <WISE Up Action> Oh God, give me anything to radicalise parties against Tories.
[2015-05-07 19:12:51] <noll> Jen, are you in US, if so can you see: http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/live/bbcone
[2015-05-07 19:13:14] <LibertarianLibrarian> Oh wow, that is an awful interview. Embarrassing!
[2015-05-07 19:14:41] <LibertarianLibrarian> I’m in the US, can’t view the BBC iPlayer (which quite often irritates me as I do like some of their drama shows).
[2015-05-07 19:18:09] <LibertarianLibrarian> My parents vote Green sometimes, but that party isn’t significant here. Then again, I vote Libertarian & that’s not much better.
[2015-05-07 19:19:45] <LibertarianLibrarian> But I am hoping Vermont ‘socialist’ Bernie Sanders is going to give Clinton fits. Doubt I’d vote for him, but he’s a character & quite

[2015-05-07 20:31:49] <noll> completely agree. neo-liberalism, when will it be taken on? at least SNP has proven there are votes/ power for at least voicing opposition.
[2015-05-07 20:37:19] <WISE Up Action> Yep-in some ways I think mass shout out coming from Scotland is greater hope for any change even if it’s bad news short term for rest o us

[2015-05-07 20:40:25] <WISE Up Action> It’s heartening that (whatever SNP is actually like) NS was strident for anti-austerity and that must be largely what the vote is for
[2015-05-07 20:42:24] <WISE Up Action> and the turnout in Scotland so big. I’m just relieved to see ANYTHING that gives hope that people will vote so vociferously for change
[2015-05-07 20:51:04] <WISE Up Action> Yeah-that’s exactly what I hope.And I don’t know how clear it is how much the vote in Scotland is for independence & how much agnst policies
[2015-05-07 20:51:27] <WISE Up Action> that have dominated in UK
[2015-05-07 20:54:02] <noll> – even SNP don’t want full independence (read Wls cables). it’s all about London establishment policies (see death of Tories 80s, then –

[2015-05-08 03:33:06] <WISE Up Wales> …and the Tories on their own get to take full responsibility and blame for what they do…
[2015-05-08 03:33:49] <WISE Up Wales> …and there are (hopefully) still a few libertarian Tories to cause Cameron some problems.

[2015-05-08 06:39:22] <LibertarianLibrarian> Interesting quote from the story further down “Cameron has heard Salmond’s Scottish lion roar and wants to tame the beast.” I.e. more
[2015-05-08 06:39:38] <LibertarianLibrarian> political doublespeak
[2015-05-08 06:40:04] <LibertarianLibrarian> But at least he has to pay some attention.
[2015-05-08 06:45:25] <Emmy B> hmm GCHQ may get higher budget & teams on SNP? Imagining Putin & Isis Brigade 77 Social Media Task force may get 3rd target.
[2015-05-08 06:53:35] <LibertarianLibrarian> I suspect you’re right Emmy. They already were targeting them, now more. But still glad to see popular defiance to that.
[2015-05-08 07:18:42] <WISE Up Action> Agree, W, but full mandate for continuation of same is dire. Immediate implications for people eg benefits,muslim community,nhs v upsetting.
[2015-05-08 07:18:51] <WISE Up Action> A change of gov does make the machine stutter a bit at least.
[2015-05-08 07:19:54] <WISE Up Action> But we mostly do get at least two terms of anyone, don’t we?
[2015-05-08 07:44:18] <noll> A, W, agree that it’ll be bad, but not sure it’ll be so much worse, unlike Thatcher era, current brood keep (at least) referencing Peel era.
[2015-05-08 07:59:30] <WISE Up Action> No-one needs to repeat Thatcher – it’s never been undone.

[2015-05-08 09:14:05] <Emmy B> Is this what GCHQ will have in store for SNP?
[2015-05-08 09:17:20] <Emmy B> the threat alone of any disclosures would probably be enough to be used at time negotiations btw Westminster/Holyrood. With current
[2015-05-08 09:17:42] <Emmy B> capabilities and motive….who will ever know.

[2015-05-08 09:21:55] <Emmy B> very interesting thanks for sharing! an incentive for labour to keep rhetoric at least on ‘workers rights’ etc
[2015-05-08 09:31:12] <noll> “Is this what GCHQ will have in store for SNP?” – seems unlikely? Tories will threaten SNP w/ independence (ie. losing £8+ billion a year).

[2015-05-08 10:27:58] <Emmy B> going through the comments in the particular article I observed that whilst most commentators put a URL intact to refer to an outside source
[2015-05-08 10:29:30] <Emmy B> 2 accounts have embedded their URL into a word/phrase ie they inserted a hyperlink. How is this possible? have they used html code in the
[2015-05-08 10:30:00] <Emmy B> comments section to embed? Does anyone now? example:

[2015-05-08 10:42:12] <noll> Em, isn’t system: select txt, URL button, pop-up field, insert URL etc? haven’t used for ages. going back to M5S: if used would follow –
[2015-05-08 10:46:17] <Emmy B> You are right, just remembered option thanks!
[2015-05-08 10:55:51] <noll> – (or one way of using) something similar to DEA/ NSA, w/ media, others using “parallel construction” cover where information originated.
[2015-05-08 11:01:25] <Emmy B> Yes, agree, it would have to be.
[2015-05-08 11:03:34] <Emmy B> So several risks facing politicians with GCHQ capabilities: 1. blackmail 2. exposure (parallel construction) to discredit
[2015-05-08 11:04:39] <Emmy B> 3. various forms of sabotage via leaking to political adversaries both in own party or competitor party… where r the politics professors
[2015-05-08 11:07:12] <Emmy B> writing about all this? and only Caroline Lucas has taken gov to court regarding Wilson rights…what happened to this case anyway?
[2015-05-08 11:07:14] <noll> yes, although 1. & 3. are extraordinarily risky, so would also need form of parallel construction.

[2015-05-08 11:09:28] <Emmy B> Interested to see SNP position on the matter, will they get ‘radicalised’ if get to taste the med. throwing their weight behind CL efforts?
[2015-05-08 11:10:22] <Emmy B> or probably could be in it too? having their own circle within the listening network.
[2015-05-08 11:12:21] <Emmy B> They certainly play to win. That is a classic problem with regulatory capture of the grand scale, if one takes a bird’s eye view.
[2015-05-08 11:13:04] <Emmy B> How can we possibly expect parties that want to govern to forego such a sweet tool of power?

[2015-05-08 14:32:43] <LibertarianLibrarian> At least you’re supposed to have a guarantee your MPs aren’t being bugged, our Congress is surely bugged and blackmailed. No doubt.
[2015-05-08 14:34:07] <LibertarianLibrarian> Be cool if Lucas could make a case and make it stick, or one or more of the SNP-ers. They’ll surely be surveilled. Who isn’t these days? 🙁

[2015-05-11 03:28:59] <WikiLeaks> Supreme court has found against JA.
[2015-05-11 03:30:01] <WikiLeaks> Very important now to point out 1) that there is a dissenting opinion that found in JA’s favour and said the warrant shoudl be quashed.
[2015-05-11 03:30:27] <WikiLeaks> i.e some judges (but not the majority) went JA’s way. i.e reasonable minds, even in sweden, differ.

[2015-05-11 09:15:46] <noll> M, full decision, archived, ‘translated’: https://archive.is/bS1uS
[2015-05-11 09:16:49] <noll> our article will be posted tmrw 6 pm – too much to get through to get it out today.
[2015-05-11 09:18:59] <noll> does anyone know what aspects of appeal arguments were not heard (ie cut off)?
[2015-05-11 09:19:49] <WikiLeaks> All of them.
[2015-05-11 09:20:11] <WikiLeaks> We only filed documents for the case to open the appeal.
[2015-05-11 09:20:37] <WikiLeaks> Then the prosecution filed documents saying that the Supreme should hear the appeal.
[2015-05-11 09:21:03] <WikiLeaks> Normally, then you “hear” the appeal. i.e then the arguments proper are made.
[2015-05-11 09:21:17] <WikiLeaks> And then the other side responds and then you respond to their response.
[2015-05-11 09:21:49] <WikiLeaks> The court made its full appeal decision just on the application to appeal, not the appeal itself.
[2015-05-11 09:22:17] <WikiLeaks> to be clear: it decided the full appeal, but just using the document set for the application to appeal
[2015-05-11 09:22:31] <WISE Up Wales> Can this departure from normal process be appealed, or is there nowhere to go with it?
[2015-05-11 09:22:38] <WikiLeaks> which is highly irrigular and neither did it notify us that it was doing that.
[2015-05-11 09:23:01] <WikiLeaks> nowhere to go under swedish law
[2015-05-11 09:23:18] <WikiLeaks> but it may feed into an ECHR case
[2015-05-11 09:23:48] <WikiLeaks> simiarly the UK supreme court decided on an argument that neither party presented. also highly irrigular. that’s what happens in
[2015-05-11 09:23:52] <noll> is there anyway we can paraphrase this? as coming from Samuelson’s team or something.
[2015-05-11 09:24:07] <WikiLeaks> super political cases. If the law is on your side, they have to cheat.
[2015-05-11 09:24:29] <WikiLeaks> it’s mentioned in the guardian article by crouch
[2015-05-11 09:26:56] <noll> political cases.. agree. yes, we have that quote, but as you get w/ msm, it’s pathetically short, w/o detail, context etc.
[2015-05-11 09:31:13] <noll> is it true that after questioning, the appeal against detention order can be rebooted?
[2015-05-11 09:34:01] <noll> / re previous: whatever, we’ll fill it out.
[2015-05-11 09:42:59] <Emmy B> Unlike prospect of success with @madsvid https://uk.linkedin.com/in/madsnj
[2015-05-11 09:54:32] <M> @Madsvid has 30k followers – but is also following 30k which suggests ‘I follow you, you follow me’, so people who don’t actually care
[2015-05-11 09:55:02] <M> Noticeable also in that they don’t receive many retweets. Plus, they don’t seem to care about facts.
[2015-05-11 10:06:23] <WikiLeaks> The follow 31k too, so the follow count likely means little.

[2015-05-12 08:31:42] <LibertarianLibrarian> OK, now I can’t see those in my timeline. Weirdness. Was going to do some more.
[2015-05-12 11:30:57] <WikiLeaks> Once those SNP MP’s get up to speed, Labour will be forced to be a lot more oppositional or else risk losing all relevance.
[2015-05-12 11:39:44] <Emmy B> But there are forces within Labour that say ‘to get to power you go right’ & majority of MPs follow such line. I hope u are right of course.

[2015-05-12 12:53:58] <Emmy B> Thank you Jenny! excellent work and so useful for our campaigns 🙂
[2015-05-12 12:56:16] <LibertarianLibrarian> Was trying to tweet WL’s new release at them this am and realized I needed an actual list, not just the few I follow. 🙂
[2015-05-12 12:59:08] <Emmy B> This is the type of work that benefits the community, never thought to make a UK MPs in Twitter list, despite Myo/me tweeting all of them.
[2015-05-12 12:59:22] <Emmy B> Will do in future! <3
[2015-05-12 13:08:16] <LibertarianLibrarian> 🙂 It will be good to throw WL releases & news and related issues at them, even a few a time.
[2015-05-12 13:14:45] <WikiLeaks> If someone can make a list of all the SNP MPs (nearly all of them new) that would be very helpful. They’re fresh at the moment.
[2015-05-12 13:15:12] <WikiLeaks> SNP is the only party of influence that has a chance of being pro-WL.

[2015-05-12 13:46:10] <LibertarianLibrarian> I’ll let one of the UK folks take the lead on listing the SNP MPs; but if needed, I can help.
[2015-05-12 16:37:58] <noll> Jen, previous FOI reply proved interesting, but yes, will see if that repeats. / our new article has expanded, will take a bit more time.

[2015-05-13 08:46:04] <LibertarianLibrarian> That article on Cameron is terrifying. Sounds like they want to stop anyone encouraging any kind of independent thought.
[2015-05-13 08:47:02] <LibertarianLibrarian> Let’s treat anyone utilizing intellectual freedom as an extremist and terrorist. How terrifying that is!
[2015-05-13 08:48:46] <LibertarianLibrarian> God forbid we dare to teach young people to think for themselves (putting aside the fact that I don’t believe in a definable God).
[2015-05-13 08:51:42] <LibertarianLibrarian> My librarian’s soul is outraged that anyone can say this kind of thing with a straight face and mean it.
[2015-05-13 09:06:04] <noll> “UK Supreme Court produced 117 pages of argument before side-stepping everything before it, but the Swedish Supreme Court only managed –
[2015-05-13 09:06:54] <noll> – eight and a half dulsetory pages.” (political judgements – different traditions).
[2015-05-13 09:14:36] <noll> Jen, agree, it’s insane. there wasn’t single ME threat or attack against UK before Iraq. legacy of war that never ends? Airstrip One
[2015-05-13 09:23:33] <LibertarianLibrarian> Amazing how people justify themselves, either by wasting time on extra documenting or trying to avoid seeing anything at all.
[2015-05-13 09:25:15] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, we brought too much of this on ourselves. Nationally and personally, the US needed to respond to 9/11 decisively. But…
[2015-05-13 09:26:40] <LibertarianLibrarian> it should have been done within 6-12 months. I know an ex-soldier who said they’d done what was needed in a few months & should’ve been out
[2015-05-13 09:27:35] <LibertarianLibrarian> This perpetual war we’ve instigated is harming everyone and only benefiting some military contractors and politicians.
[2015-05-13 09:30:07] <LibertarianLibrarian> Sadly, those making a fortune off the war have too much influence and power over our governments.
[2015-05-13 09:33:54] <Emmy B> So true Jenny!

[2015-05-13 18:10:42] <LibertarianLibrarian> like your politics, religion, ethnicity, ideas, or just that you dare question her? What are we becoming? What Orwellian nightmare is this?
[2015-05-13 18:12:11] <LibertarianLibrarian> I can’t Cameron & May are getting away with this without massive public rejection and where are the journalistic hard questions?
[2015-05-13 18:12:42] <LibertarianLibrarian> Are all the UK Press sellouts? I’m not surprised by some but…
[2015-05-13 18:14:27] <LibertarianLibrarian> Obama & Clinton wouldn’t get away with this in my country yet. They have to be sneakier. Is that better? Not sure.
[2015-05-13 23:58:38] <Emmy B> Again you are right Jenny… everyone seems to be frozen on the issue somehow here in UK but it is slowly entering the political discorse
[2015-05-14 00:23:07] <WISE Up Action> Em, sense a period of widespread conflict ahead. Unions already active, general public waking up to consequences of Tory gvt. London esp

[2015-05-14 01:50:55] <Emmy B> Something dodgy about @madsvid followers/follows all about marketing, purchase followers, branding oh & he follows the usual Guardian crowd

[DMConversationEntry] Cabledrum added WikiLeaks Press
[2015-05-14 20:12:44] <Cabledrum> A little side note re. Bundestag Inquiry into NSA:
[2015-05-14 20:12:48] <Cabledrum> Johannes Eisenberg, a (former?) lawyer of WL, served as legal adviser for seven witnesses, all from BND, incl. General Breitfelder.
[2015-05-14 20:12:55] <Cabledrum> Of course, everyone has the right to legal assistance.
[2015-05-14 20:13:01] <Cabledrum> But obviously, Eisenberg is a contractor of the BND. That doesn’t make him necessarily trustworthy.
[2015-05-14 21:24:43] <Emmy B> Thanks for this! There is so much out there in German about the new publication but difficult to follow.
[2015-05-14 21:25:05] <Emmy B> Has it been well received?
[2015-05-14 23:39:16] <Emmy B> I will be doing an SNP Twitter member List today http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/14/snp-mps-flout-commons-etiquette-with-first-day-tweets
[2015-05-15 03:41:03] <Emmy B> This might be of interest maybe CD you can explain it to us a bit

[2015-05-15 06:00:41] <Cabledrum> First of all, the documents show how all concerned parties systematically try to block the work of the inquiry commission.
[2015-05-15 06:01:04] <Cabledrum> The witnesses from BND and Telekom “can’t remember”, “was not responsible”, “do not know” and so on
[2015-05-15 06:01:51] <Cabledrum> For instance, the former CEO of Telekom, Kai-Uwe Ricke, had a four-eyes-meeting with the chief of the BND…
[2015-05-15 06:01:55] <Cabledrum> …but can’t remember what they’ve been talking about
[2015-05-15 06:02:33] <Cabledrum> The newspaper article you mentioned, “Kauder and Maaßen criticize WikiLeaks”, comes from the “Welt”, a very conservative newspaper
[2015-05-15 06:03:42] <Cabledrum> Volker Kauder (CDU parliamentary leader) is a conservative hardliner.Hans-Georg Maaßen is the chief of Germany’s domestic secret service BfV
[2015-05-15 06:04:03] <Cabledrum> Kauder criticizes that the WL release “might threaten the cooperation of German secret services with the NSA”
[2015-05-15 06:06:25] <Cabledrum> (hopefully, he’s right)
[2015-05-15 06:08:57] <Emmy B> Let’s hope so, yes! Thank you very much for this Cabledrummer.
[2015-05-15 06:09:45] <Emmy B> I only took a quick look at the english reports but there is little analysis in English for the latest release.

[2015-05-15 20:32:14] <Emmy B> court decided on an argument that neither party presented, rather than set precedent through.. bypassing of ECtHR case-law “that is correct”
[2015-05-15 20:32:32] <Emmy B> I can’t grasp completely this point
[2015-05-15 20:32:57] <LibertarianLibrarian> Thanks for sharing! On the second one – see if you can make it clearer where you are showing the courts’ opinion distinct from your response
[2015-05-15 20:33:31] <LibertarianLibrarian> A couple of spots weren’t clear, sounded like you were arguing their side not opposing it.
[2015-05-15 20:34:05] <LibertarianLibrarian> Otherwise, these are wonderful!
[2015-05-15 20:34:55] <Emmy B> particularly this bit “rather than set precedent through.. bypassing of ECtHR case-law “that is correct””
[2015-05-15 20:39:39] <noll> if means, that in order to rule against JA, the UK SC would have had to set a UK case-law precedent, that bypassed EU case-law precedents.
[2015-05-15 20:43:04] <noll> & SC wasn’t willing to do that, & besides, why do it when you can just, not ignore, but bypass presented arguments, by ruling on something –
[2015-05-15 20:43:47] <Emmy B> thank you, that explains it pls consider putting it in like that? it would make it clearer to an international audience 🙂
[2015-05-15 20:43:59] <noll> – else.
[2015-05-15 20:44:14] <noll> yes, will tidy that up.
[2015-05-15 20:44:16] <Emmy B> spell check “ablity”
[2015-05-15 20:44:25] <Emmy B> *reading*
[2015-05-15 20:46:36] <Emmy B> The Hyperlinked article in”According to Thomas Olsson (representing Assange), Ny is yet to submit MLA requests to either the UK or Ecuador.”
[2015-05-15 20:47:54] <Emmy B> does not support the statement you make, it just states that the interview date has not been set, it des not say MLA requests not submitted
[2015-05-15 20:48:07] <Emmy B> did I misunderstand?
[2015-05-15 20:48:47] <noll> yes, “they need to make a request” can only mean they have’t made one.
[2015-05-15 20:49:32] <noll> fixed “ablity”, thanks. :o)
[2015-05-15 20:49:55] <noll> *haven’t
[2015-05-15 20:52:22] <Emmy B> “although politically the process in Sweden is dead.” you mean the appeal?
[2015-05-15 20:56:01] <noll> yes, to restart the process is now pointless. the decision was so blatantly political, devoid of any concern for the law or argument, that –
[2015-05-15 20:58:12] <noll> – to attack it in Sweden’s courts is futile. b/c after all (as w/ UK) the SC has ruled..
[2015-05-15 21:00:20] <Emmy B> Well, following this case I am delighted to have the political nature of judicial authorities exposed. Still, as such there is a state of
[2015-05-15 21:00:26] <Emmy B> continuous flux
[2015-05-15 21:00:45] <Emmy B> it seems the only limitation is resources, financial or otherwise.
[2015-05-15 21:02:27] <Emmy B> By starting last summer, the legal team has come a long way in exposing several weaknesses and ultimately penetrate the ‘authority tower’ of
[2015-05-15 21:03:50] <Emmy B> Mrs Ny in the court of public opinion, questioning her judgement and operation in this manner. Equally, the Swedish Supreme court is not
[2015-05-15 21:05:10] <Emmy B> going to look pretty, still, politics is everywhere it seems…
[2015-05-15 21:06:12] <noll> there is no way the SC will reverse itself. & v. especially not after that ruling. it would be political suicide for all involved.
[2015-05-15 21:07:40] <noll> it’s now down to Ny (& the political pressures on her), one of which is the ECtHR (which could well reverse Swe SC).
[2015-05-15 21:08:50] <Emmy B> ‘in light of new evidence’ etc etc, authority has the privilege to re-define acceptability. But of course you are right, pressure now is on.
[2015-05-15 21:10:09] <noll> note how both UK & Swe SCs avoided taking on ECtHR precedents, various actors may not want case to go there. yes, pressure is definitely on.
[2015-05-15 21:10:32] <Emmy B> Thanks for all your hard work <3 my goodness were is the dawn in this country of perpetual overcast?
[2015-05-15 21:11:50] <noll> it seems like dusk. we must get some sleep. will get back to this later on. xx
[2015-05-15 21:12:12] <Emmy B> Good idea! xx

[2015-05-16 09:41:09] <WikiLeaks> Good work, Emmy on that list.
[2015-05-16 09:42:24] <WikiLeaks> Is there a way to search the list output, e.g from:greekemmy/list/blah?
[2015-05-16 10:03:18] <M> I couldn’t find a built-in functionality for searching lists. Tutorials I saw were just copying all the account names into adv search.
[2015-05-16 10:05:10] <M> The list is pretty long, so for this method, you’d have to divide it into 3 separate searches to cover all members.

[2015-05-16 14:51:53] <WikiLeaks> Emmy, do you have a similar list for the Scottish domestic MPs?
[2015-05-16 15:12:58] <Emmy B> No, but I can get it done tomorrow.
[2015-05-16 15:40:00] <Emmy B> SNP got 69 seats at 2011 Holyrood elections (out of 129), next election is 5th May 2016.
[2015-05-16 15:43:15] <Emmy B> I just found a public list compiled by @thesnp (official twitter account) with 57 MSPs (Members of Scottish Parliament)
[2015-05-16 15:43:40] <Emmy B> Here: https://twitter.com/theSNP/lists/snp-msps
[2015-05-16 15:45:02] <Emmy B> I will work on this list to make one for all 129 MSPs.
[2015-05-16 15:45:30] <Emmy B> tomorrow 🙂
[2015-05-16 15:50:43] <Emmy B> One of the SNP MPs has compiled a public list of Media journos focusing on Scotland, might be of use: https://twitter.com/alisonthewliss/lists/journo-list/members
[2015-05-16 16:45:18] <Emmy B> Oh, Found another list with 120 MSP https://twitter.com/newsdirect/lists/msps/members
[2015-05-16 19:38:11] <LibertarianLibrarian> Oh, that’s helpful of that Scottish MP. 🙂
[2015-05-16 19:50:48] <noll> amazing work Em :o) we’d like to take time out & help w/ any twitter campaign re lists, just let us know what to post, will give up evening.
[2015-05-16 19:53:52] <noll> will do via @hazelpress2, for obvious reasons like to keep main account spartan.
[2015-05-16 22:11:47] <WISE Up Wales> Anyone know about this UK whistleblower? – can only find this one opinion piece:
http://www.heraldscotland.com/comment/sunday-herald-view/why-this-whistleblowers-warnings-should-spell-the-death-knell-for-trident.126268713
[2015-05-16 22:13:45] <WISE Up Wales> Ah, he’s commented here:
[2015-05-16 22:15:55] <WISE Up Wales> http://www.youblisher.com/p/1138795-William/
[2015-05-16 22:16:06] <WISE Up Wales> working covertly to eliminate the biggest threat to the UK for about a year. My real intentions along with more than enough information to
[2015-05-16 22:16:19] <WISE Up Wales> eliminate the Trident programme are contained in a report that was released on the 05-05-15. Almost all of my email accounts have been …
[2015-05-16 22:16:29] <WISE Up Wales> blocked and I’m in hide out in a foreign country; I might be arrested or killed before the public can read the report. I don’t know how many
[2015-05-16 22:16:38] <WISE Up Wales> laws I’ve broken along the way; I doubt men live long enough to serve the sentence they’ll give me. Anyone who reads it will understand:
[2015-05-16 22:16:47] <WISE Up Wales> my information comes from prefect sources, I have no reason to lie and they will understand if change isn’t made a nuclear catastrophe
[2015-05-16 22:16:58] <WISE Up Wales> almost certainly will happen! My ID and photos are in the report, it will break news soon, but no media outlet will publish the full report
[2015-05-16 22:17:02] <WISE Up Wales> because it contains TS information. I have sacrificed everything please help me end this world order of fear!
[2015-05-16 22:17:33] <WISE Up Wales> end quote. Link to comment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN2l5KX0EbY
[2015-05-16 22:19:25] <WISE Up Wales> Sounds like he needs help. Ideas? Will forward the new WL submission link.
@wikileaks
[2015-05-16 22:24:45] <WISE Up Wales> Oh, report seems to be already on this link: http://www.youblisher.com/p/1138795-William/
[2015-05-17 01:30:53] <WISE Up Wales> Thanks for the SNP list Emmy! Just about to use it for the above and for this: http://wp.me/p54cDs-oZ
[2015-05-17 01:32:40] <WISE Up Wales> …if I can work out how to use it. Can I send one message that will go to all on the list? Or do I have to tweet one by one?
[2015-05-17 01:47:45] <WISE Up Wales> Oh, they’re for reading tweets only? I’ll have to send messages one by one then I guess. That’s not nearly so attractive! :o(
[2015-05-17 02:25:37] <Emmy B> Yes g that’s right, only individual tweets. Sorry.
[2015-05-17 02:28:54] <Emmy B> has the herald checked the story?
[2015-05-17 02:45:45] <Emmy B> (I am on paywall)
[2015-05-17 03:11:14] <WISE Up Wales> I presume it must have done checks to run it as front page. I haven’t read Herald article, only editorial. Full info https://indymedia.org.uk/en/2015/05/520573.html
[2015-05-17 03:12:26] <WISE Up Wales> He says he intends to hand himself in to police.

[2015-05-17 05:51:43] <noll> Wales, thanks for info. “cover-up of collision with French nuclear submarine” no wonder Brown offered to ditch sub.. https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09LONDON2222_a.html
[2015-05-17 05:53:06] <noll> Jen, yep. & so obviously doctored can only assume someone wanted to make it obvious.
[2015-05-17 05:56:19] <LibertarianLibrarian> Good luck with project!
[2015-05-17 05:56:36] <LibertarianLibrarian> Em, same here re help with lists.

[2015-05-17 13:21:33] <Emmy B> Thanks for the offers of help! ok at the mo.
[2015-05-17 13:22:56] <Emmy B> This is it https://twitter.com/greekemmy/lists/holyrood-msp-2011-2016/members
[2015-05-17 13:24:13] <Emmy B> Regarding Mark p (ex Pickett) 21st of May the next hearing. I will not even bother reading whatever comes form that place.
[2015-05-17 13:25:48] <Emmy B> I spent a good part of a year shaking in my boots ‘oh my god he is going to harm WL’ I am shaking no more. He is a liar through and through.
[2015-05-17 13:28:16] <Emmy B> He has been proved so again and again and again. He uses fear to get attention from the community. This time I will not oblige 🙂
[2015-05-17 15:57:50] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, Emmy, that’s the best approach. The only ones who pay any attention are his same group of trolls. You can see that clearly.
[2015-05-18 08:34:34] <noll> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/greekemmy/status/600284448035319808
[2015-05-18 08:38:58] <M> This method is not reliable. WikiLeaks is placed at White House. Russell Brand placed at University of Texas. I’m placed at US gov building.
[2015-05-18 08:39:41] <M> I don’t know the rationale behind it, but a lot of users get placed at US government buildings.
[2015-05-18 08:39:57] <M> Think too that a lot of people use Tor.
[2015-05-18 08:50:22] <Emmy B> I don’t put any significance too (other the entertainment factor) it is curious though that out of all the troll list twitter handles
[2015-05-18 08:51:22] <noll> all the same it’s hilarious (@hazelpress turns up: Revolution Live, Fort Lauderdale, Florida). fyi FOI three is not getting a case no. –
[2015-05-18 08:51:34] <Emmy B> MGT(forum) and AT(PGPBoard) show at US Embassy London as well as when I type MGT’s name on google maps.
[2015-05-18 08:52:04] <Emmy B> (I am UK Supreme Court hahaha)
[2015-05-18 08:52:16] <M> I see. Possibly in some instances it is accurate, but it is so random that it has no weight as evidence.
[2015-05-18 08:53:20] <Emmy B> Agree totally but we have inadvertently produced a win 🙂
[2015-05-18 08:54:22] <noll> we’ve rewritten it: https://hazelpress.wordpress.com/2015/05/12/fois/

[2015-05-18 08:58:00] <Emmy B> While he is doxing me, MGT makes an error, he forgets to log out of his Google account, he does it four times. I have archived and passing
[2015-05-18 08:58:45] <Emmy B> on to Chris and Cabledrum for their court cases. This is more evidence MGT still in control of Forum’s twitter account which he denies.
[2015-05-18 08:59:57] <Emmy B> Pls do not share in twitter or he will delete tweets, the longer they stay up the better it is.
[2015-05-18 09:02:59] <WikiLeaks> Emmy; good find.
[2015-05-18 09:20:11] <Emmy B> Thx <3
[2015-05-18 09:21:24] <Emmy B> Gary told me Asher Wolf discovered the Google maps feature. I played around and produced the shots but it was a friend who saw the value &
[2015-05-18 09:22:47] <Emmy B> encouraged me to share. Then it caught on by others which made MGT ‘lose his marbles’ & wanting revenge doxed me/cabledrum etc and he made
[2015-05-18 09:23:49] <Emmy B> the mistake so it was ‘a group effort’ which is the best part of it as we win twice a. co-operation b. good result *grin*
[2015-05-18 09:24:59] <Emmy B> and he hopefully loses where it matters: in court.
[2015-05-18 09:32:07] <noll> “damn, now everyone knows [who tweets from @wikileaks_forum]”, evidence we’ve seen is rock solid (& v. funny), this is icing on cake, –
[2015-05-18 09:32:11] <noll> great stuff! :o)
[2015-05-18 09:56:29] <Cabledrum> Great find, Emmy! Imho, we can tweet it. It’s archived and several witnesses have seen it. It doesn’t matter whether he deletes the tweets
[2015-05-18 10:43:25] <WikiLeaks> Please don’t tweet it.
[2015-05-18 10:43:37] <WikiLeaks> He may make more similar mistakes.
[2015-05-18 10:51:44] <Cabledrum> Grmpf, ok. 3 days left until court decision…
[2015-05-18 10:54:54] <WikiLeaks> Yes. Why have him warning. It should be a surprise.
[2015-05-18 12:11:40] <Emmy B> Thank you Cabledrummer! 🙂 I wish all the very best and please keep us informed with developments!
[2015-05-18 22:14:52] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, agree. Catch him by surprise in court. 🙂 And good luck!
[2015-05-18 22:37:03] <Emmy B> He already deleted tweets probably realised error when he was making this forum post (archived) https://archive.is/pq4qK
[2015-05-19 04:01:09] <Cabledrum> Very good, Emmy! This is evidence for both, the forum and the twitter acc. The forum post is still online with his name on the screenshots
[2015-05-19 04:03:40] <LibertarianLibrarian> Great!
[2015-05-19 04:04:17] <Cabledrum> Jenny : “Catch him by surprise in court” doesn’t work out in Germany. All evidence has to be presented to the court in advance 🙁
[2015-05-19 04:05:44] <LibertarianLibrarian> Actually it probably does in the US too, at least in criminal court, I think. Not sure. Never dealt with more than traffic court.
[2015-05-19 04:07:07] <LibertarianLibrarian> Just thinking no need to advance warn him on twitter rather than in court docs. But it seems he knows he messed up anyway.
[2015-05-19 08:10:16] <Emmy B> For sure it is the same screenshots but at the forum post he has cropped his name out.

[2015-05-19 13:02:57] <Emmy B> Shall we share 1st of June event with SNP MPs?
[2015-05-19 13:56:00] <noll> worth watching (if only to see how moribund hipster-journalism compared to geek): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMe04sFIcqU#wanted2015: Lyndon LaRouche
[2015-05-19 13:56:21] <noll> Em, we would :o)
[2015-05-19 20:15:54] <Cabledrum> Emmy: No, the screenshots at FWLF are not cropped, his name is clearly visible.. Note the scrollbar at the bottom..
[2015-05-19 23:07:59] <Emmy B> Cabledrummer You are right! I was looking at the archived link that does not capture the bar and that section on the picture.
[2015-05-19 23:08:07] <Emmy B> Have you managed to capture this?
[2015-05-19 23:09:29] <Emmy B> (Gosh, good thing we didn’t tweet about it) Maybe the waybackmachine captures the bar? (I don’t know)
[2015-05-19 23:10:37] <Emmy B> @ H thank you for the video, watched some of it, made my hair curl!!! US funding facists but htis is exactly what they did to Greece after
[2015-05-19 23:11:45] <Emmy B> the war (in the name of anti-communism) and opposed the Greek gov efforts to close the concentration camps for political prisoners
[2015-05-19 23:12:45] <Emmy B> and their families, even in the mid 50’s, again interfering in the late 60’s with their support of the junta, 7 years of hell all with the
[2015-05-19 23:14:02] <Emmy B> blessing of CIA torture training, leading up to the national betrayal at Cyprus in 1974 (the attempt to impose junta there
[2015-05-19 23:14:50] <Emmy B> and the attempted overthrow of Makarios which gave the perfect opportunity to Turkey -preparing for an invasion since the 50’s- to finally
[2015-05-19 23:16:47] <Emmy B> invade with the assistance of US/UK and Israel…Eastern Europe did suffer under USSR, Greek experience says “Belonging to the west” also
[2015-05-19 23:17:35] <Emmy B> came at a heavy price for Human Rights, national sovereignty and even national security.
[2015-05-19 23:19:25] <Emmy B> (Listening to Frontline club questions from Rumanian journo about Russia being a threat to Rumania, I could just kick the journo,
[2015-05-19 23:20:32] <Emmy B> does he think that Nato membership will offer security? on the contrary, for small countries it is just changing one master for another.)
[2015-05-19 23:22:42] <Emmy B> With the added risk that your protector (like a pimp) might actually send you packing to your enemy’s arms..occasionally…
[2015-05-19 23:23:02] <Emmy B> as a chip to their own bargaining, for their own interests.
[2015-05-19 23:23:17] <Emmy B> (apologies for the rant).
[2015-05-20 00:52:31] <Emmy B> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/greekemmy/status/600915070223294466 Got an RT from SNP MP https://twitter.com/greekemmy/status/[email protected]_PaulMonaghan for courage foundation, please someone, maybe WiseUps tweet at him too thx
[2015-05-20 05:44:26] <Cabledrum> Emmy: Yes, captured on archive.is and wayback machine, both with working scrollbar https://archive.is/pq4qKhttp://web.archive.org/web/20150520123726/http://www.wikileaks-forum.com/atgreekemmy-aka-emilia-butlin/634/the-weird-world-of-assange-groupie-humor/33797/
[2015-05-20 06:31:39] <Emmy B> Excellent! Hope your lawyer can use them in advance of tomorrow’s hearing, all the best!
[2015-05-20 06:36:01] <WikiLeaks> Emmy, re, rewteet; exactly what we were hoping for. Be the troll you want to see in the world.
[2015-05-20 06:38:15] <Emmy B> 🙂 My dear WL putting best foot forward and let’s see 🙂
[2015-05-20 06:47:12] <Emmy B> He RTed WiseUp!!! (16 rts) too 🙂
[2015-05-20 06:49:05] <WikiLeaks> Did you hit all the mps?
[2015-05-20 06:49:15] <WikiLeaks> Also, can you change your icon to something less creepy?
[2015-05-20 06:49:36] <WikiLeaks> It may help when approaching people.
[2015-05-20 11:15:26] <Cabledrum> I’ve just received a new preliminary injunction, for this tweet: https://archive.is/Qbu99
[2015-05-20 11:15:29] <Cabledrum> I’ve removed this tweet 3 day later by request of [MGT]’s lawyer.
[2015-05-20 11:15:35] <Cabledrum> I have no idea why they seek a preliminary injunction, in spite of the fact that the concerned tweet has already been removed
[2015-05-20 11:20:38] <noll> re variations on media narrative: ‘Wls by helping ES assisted AQ’, OBL letter is of use. https://twitter.com/hazelpress/status/601082297723580416
[2015-05-20 11:36:53] <noll> Em, maybe look at SMaurizi/ suigenerisjen/ carwinb’s icons, & if needed ask someone to do quick photo-shoot? xx
[2015-05-20 11:44:01] <WISE Up Wales> Hey WL & all – this is getting a bit personal. Hope no one’s saying Emmy’s lovely face is creepy! :o) FWIW I thought the eye icon was fine.
[2015-05-20 11:52:21] <Emmy B> Yes well, not the happiest of feedback but I have now changed my avatar into a sun, one of Somerset Bean’s work, which I admire so it is all
[2015-05-20 11:52:34] <Emmy B> good!
[2015-05-20 11:54:43] <noll> it’s not personal, it’s just a bad photo (& we’ve all experienced that countless times..), & not ideal for campaigning. maybe Bean could –
[2015-05-20 11:55:23] <Emmy B> no Bean could not 🙂 thanks
[2015-05-20 11:56:00] <noll> – knock something together?.. or not! :o)
[2015-05-20 12:39:38] <LibertarianLibrarian> I liked the eye icon, actually thought about imitating it, but the sun icon is really nice and striking also.
[2015-05-20 12:40:32] <LibertarianLibrarian> Good luck tomorrow, Cabledrummer. Hopefully, you can make some progress vs MGT’s insanity
[2015-05-20 12:41:29] <LibertarianLibrarian> Still catching up from the conference but if you need help tweeting to the SNP MPs or whatever else, let me know!
[2015-05-20 12:42:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> I got to give a 5 minute presentation on the importance of online privacy in communities and our libraries in a session on librarian
[2015-05-20 12:42:42] <LibertarianLibrarian> Activism. That was good.
[2015-05-20 12:43:19] <Emmy B> Thank you Jenny! I saw the response, excellent work 🙂
[2015-05-20 12:46:56] <LibertarianLibrarian> 🙂 I asked Julian’s question, who has a smart phone, then turned it around and asked who didn’t…we actually had 1 person say she didn’t.
[2015-05-20 12:47:19] <LibertarianLibrarian> I told everyone else they were under surveillance. They laughed.
[2015-05-20 12:47:48] <LibertarianLibrarian> But hopefully I made a few people pay attention.
[2015-05-20 12:48:47] <noll> speaking of which: http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2015/may/20/rand-paul-senate-filibuster-nsa-spying-patriot-act-live
[2015-05-20 12:48:57] <WikiLeaks> Cable, you should look at the process in germany to declare someone a vexacious litigant.
[2015-05-20 12:50:36] <noll> Bean, could you post temp URL containing HD version of graphic Em is using? it’s great for icon, but bit blurry.
[2015-05-20 12:51:07] <LibertarianLibrarian> Brilliant! Paul & Wyden don’t always get it right but seeing them filibuster the Patriot Act rocks!
[2015-05-20 12:51:32] <LibertarianLibrarian> Good idea, WL
[2015-05-20 12:52:56] <noll> Jen, agree on both. :o)

[2015-05-20 15:45:54] <Emmy B> Plenty of commentaries to engage with.
[2015-05-21 00:07:39] <Emmy B> This guy also very outspoken in support of McNeilly @euanwrites giving interviews etc…
[2015-05-21 02:58:53] <Emmy B> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/GreenJennyJones/status/601325362937733120 Got an RT from Jenny Jones on the Wise up blog post about the 3rd Anniversary Vigil outside the embassy.
[2015-05-21 03:00:03] <Emmy B> Seems she is happy to interact – Follow up would be good 🙂
[2015-05-21 06:40:52] <Cabledrum> Today’s court decision in my case has been postponed until tomorrow for technical reasons
[2015-05-21 06:41:17] <Cabledrum> There has been a “fairly final” decision in PC’s case, but I don’t know any details yet
[2015-05-21 08:18:56] <Cabledrum> Bad news: As it seems, the court has rejected PC’s claim
[2015-05-21 08:42:31] <Emmy B> Written explanation end of next week. Court said too complicated for a verbal explanation.
[2015-05-21 09:11:49] <LibertarianLibrarian> Sorry to hear that Cabledrummer – hope your case goes well tomorrow!
[2015-05-21 09:57:37] <WikiLeaks> Rejected under what basis?
[2015-05-21 10:03:12] <noll> how it could be rejected? MGT libeled PC & JA repeatedly, at this point it’s an easily provable fact.
[2015-05-21 10:55:26] <Cabledrum> WL: The court didn’t explain the decision in any way. We have to wait for the written reasons for the judgment
[2015-05-21 10:58:03] <Cabledrum> PC intends to appeal against the judgement by all means

[2015-05-22 01:12:12] <noll> can we point this out again, Carr’s (v. important for Wls) testimony was on 31 July, but where is that day here: http://www.chelseamanning.org/stenographer-transcripts/stenographer-transcripts-from-the-court-martial
[2015-05-22 01:53:19] <Emmy B> I don’t know how many time I have shared this but it is a must. http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/30/athens-1944-britains-dirty-secret

[2015-05-22 02:07:10] <WISE Up Wales> I’m working on a rush McNeilly/Trident flyer for tomorrow & Mon. Will share a generic version later in case anyone else can use.
[2015-05-22 02:32:10] <Bean> If you’d like me to give it a go, I’ve a couple of ‘spare’ hours tonight. Just email me bean[at]somersetbean[dot]com
[2015-05-22 02:37:29] <WISE Up Wales> Hey, thanks, but I’ve done what I need for tomorrow now., if I can get it to save as a pdf on old laptop where my very old dtp prog is…
[2015-05-22 02:37:55] <WISE Up Wales> …but I’m sure there’s a need for solidarity flyers people can print.
[2015-05-22 02:38:54] <WISE Up Wales> …properly designed, like! Did I imagine that you’re based in uk at present?
[2015-05-22 02:45:16] <Bean> No probs – I’m sure you’ve done it beautifully 🙂 But yes here of course for future materials! Another month, and I’m over there – Bristol.
[2015-05-22 04:32:26] <WISE Up Action> I’m looking to go to the Stand Up for Truth talk on 1st (Ellsberg, Drake, Radack et al) so will print some off if available. D
[2015-05-22 04:33:02] <WISE Up Action> Should say that I’m rubbish at designing my own!
[2015-05-22 04:41:50] <Emmy B> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/greekemmy/status/601708159410040832 Short feedback by Deputy London Mayor Roger Evans on my enquiry to London Assembly here:
[2015-05-22 05:08:44] <Emmy B> who now follows me *scratching head*
[2015-05-22 05:49:14] <LibertarianLibrarian> It’s pretty amazing sometimes who will follow you on Twitter. 🙂
[2015-05-22 05:50:22] <LibertarianLibrarian> I wish I could afford to fly over for your upcoming events. Last summer in London was my travel budget for a couple of years.
[2015-05-22 05:50:37] <LibertarianLibrarian> But my heart’s with you and with Julian.
[2015-05-22 06:47:58] <Emmy B> Thank you Jenny we have started the campaign with good exposure so far, we have a great vigil last year and hope for the same this year <3
[2015-05-22 06:48:14] <Emmy B> Many thanks to everyone for the RTs !
[2015-05-22 06:49:26] <LibertarianLibrarian> I wish we didn’t need to keep having the vigils but last year’s was excellent and I think you’ll be just as strong this year.
[2015-05-22 06:50:27] <Emmy B> Thanks for the encouragement Jenny 🙂
[2015-05-22 07:17:18] <WISE Up Wales> Yeah, sure it will be excellent.
[2015-05-22 07:18:14] <WISE Up Wales> I’ve just posted this as a page on wise up. At present it’s not linked to a post…

[2015-05-22 07:32:32] <Emmy B> Wonderful work!
[2015-05-22 08:13:16] <Cabledrum> I still don’t have a court decision. The clerk’s office of the court was closed today for unknown reasons.
[2015-05-22 08:13:23] <Cabledrum> Monday is a bank holiday in Germany, so we have to wait until Tuesday
[2015-05-22 08:16:45] <LibertarianLibrarian> That’s frustrating cabledrum, hang in there!
[2015-05-22 08:17:32] <LibertarianLibrarian> Nice, WiseupW!
[2015-05-22 08:25:56] <Emmy B> Bizarre!
[2015-05-22 11:54:10] <WikiLeaks> Are you able to bill MGT for the costs if you win, Cable?
[2015-05-22 11:58:58] <Emmy B> Hi everyone! I am off for a few days with limited access to wifi, will keep an eye but activity limited, back on Thursday 🙂
[2015-05-22 12:05:04] <LibertarianLibrarian> Enjoy your holiday, Emmy
[2015-05-22 12:59:08] <Emmy B> Thx Jenny!
[2015-05-22 15:42:24] <Cabledrum> WL: If I win, MGT has to pay my lawyer and the court costs, all in all approx. 3000 Euros, plus his own lawyer

[2015-05-22 18:19:51] <M> I’m not a programming person, so I don’t know what this means or if it is fixable, but something to look at.
[2015-05-22 19:49:01] <Cabledrum> That message is not part of the website but part of the URL, harmless crap. Example: http://tinyurl.com/py8vkcd
[2015-05-22 19:55:17] <M> Right. I didn’t think it was harmful, but it seems like an odd thing to be able to do.
[2015-05-25 21:18:03] <Emmy B> @ h I don’t seem to find your post with fwlf defamatory tweets and can I include it in my post “Days and Works”?
[2015-05-26 03:27:52] <noll> Em, here: http://hazelpress.org/libel-tweets-fwlf/4589011962
[2015-05-26 03:30:09] <Emmy B> Great thanks!
[2015-05-26 06:28:08] <Cabledrum> The Frankfurt district court has annulled the preliminary injunction concerning the publication of [MGT]’s photo 🙂
[2015-05-26 06:31:55] <WikiLeaks> Congrats cable. Did you get a costs order, too?
[2015-05-26 06:31:56] <Cabledrum> The court seems to be completely overloaded. I still have to wait for the written reasons for the judgment “for one or two weeks”
[2015-05-26 06:35:24] <Cabledrum> No. MGT has to pay the court fees and the lawyers, since he lost
[2015-05-26 06:36:06] <WikiLeaks> Great. But who will collect the debt? You or the court?
[2015-05-26 06:37:02] <Cabledrum> But I’m afraid that he has a legal protection insurance, in contrast to me
[2015-05-26 06:39:00] <WikiLeaks> How does that work? Does he have it generally, who is paying for it? Or did he just pay extra for that case, as an insurance fee?
[2015-05-26 06:39:53] <Cabledrum> It’s 3 bills, one from the court and 2 from the lawyers. My lawyer already sent his bill to MGT today
[2015-05-26 06:41:20] <WikiLeaks> He may well not pay your lawyers bills, which would be good. Then they can use standard debt collection techniques to map out…
[2015-05-26 06:41:34] <WikiLeaks> his holdings and money flows.
[2015-05-26 06:42:33] <Cabledrum> I don’t know. Legal protection insurance is expensive. I guess, that he concluded an insurance after the PC case started
[2015-05-26 06:43:28] <Cabledrum> hmm, that’s a very long way, could take years
[2015-05-26 06:43:57] <WikiLeaks> He likely did so fraudulently if he paid for it himself. Insurance companies would want to know expected claims in advance.
[2015-05-26 06:44:33] <WikiLeaks> The fees would be so high as to not make it worthwhile if they knew all his pending legal actions.
[2015-05-26 06:48:03] <Cabledrum> yes, that’s why he sued me for the recent publications of his photo but ignored the publications of last year
[2015-05-26 06:57:06] <Cabledrum> Just for the records: MGT only lost the preliminary injunction now. The principal proceedings in this case goes on trial in October
[2015-05-26 08:01:45] <LibertarianLibrarian> It’s still a great beginning! Congrats Cabledum!
[2015-05-26 08:03:21] <LibertarianLibrarian> It would be interesting to know the cost of legal insurance in Germany, esp. for someone who doesn’t have a professional requirement for it.
[2015-05-26 08:04:10] <LibertarianLibrarian> In the states Doctors are basically required to have malpractice insurance and it costs them a lot. Probably some other fields as well.
[2015-05-26 08:05:19] <LibertarianLibrarian> I did have some legal insurance offered to me at the University of Florida, but it was basics, like rapid access to an attorney, lower fees.
[2015-05-26 08:05:37] <LibertarianLibrarian> SUNY doesn’t offer it.
[2015-05-26 08:08:09] <LibertarianLibrarian> Bet he’s paying and arm & a leg for it. Be nice to know how much – indicates he knows he’s doing stuff to land him in court & lose.
[2015-05-26 08:08:47] <LibertarianLibrarian> Also wonder if he’s being ‘helped’.
[2015-05-26 08:09:55] <LibertarianLibrarian> But I agree, if you win in October, best to get your costs paid ASAP before he wiggles out and/or the insurance co. drops him.
[2015-05-26 08:51:06] <WikiLeaks> What is the name of the company providing legal insurance?
[2015-05-26 10:06:50] <Emmy B> Congratulations Cabledrummer!
[2015-05-26 11:51:25] <Cabledrum> WL: It’s just an assumption that MGT has a legal insurance. I have no idea which one it might be.
[2015-05-26 13:02:49] <noll> congrats Cables, hope main event goes as well. any news re reasoning behinds PC judgement?
[2015-05-26 13:06:07] <Emmy B> Chris has asked me for absolute discretion in the next few weeks/months regarding her case as she escalates her efforts.
[2015-05-26 13:07:01] <noll> understood.
[2015-05-26 13:08:08] <Emmy B> There is a long road till conclusive outcome is reached. I am trying to assist with gathering evidence, offering support. Patience everyone.

[2015-05-26 13:18:18] <LibertarianLibrarian> Absolutely, Emmy.

[2015-05-28 06:21:36] <Emmy B> the guarding of the Ecuadorian Embassy (I don’t know how to do it) maybe @ M can add it to ‘This day in WL’ – don’t know but maybe can be

[2015-05-28 06:24:51] <Emmy B> The video is available on i-player (UK TV license holding) for 28 days. If u cannot access it, maybe someone can tell me how to do it. Thx!

[2015-05-28 09:36:00] <Cabledrum> hazel: Has Twitter notified you in any way or has the tweet just disappeared?
[2015-05-28 10:10:02] <noll> hi Cables, Twitter required mobile number & code just to find out why account was frozen, after which tweet was disappeared (we tried to –
[2015-05-28 10:12:32] <noll> – archive but it had already gone), we then had to delete something that was already deleted. to get that kind of service – MGT must have
[2015-05-28 10:13:22] <noll> – sent himself remarkably imaginative threats.
[2015-05-28 10:30:32] <Cabledrum> Strange! Twitter didn’t ask me to remove my tweets, they are still online. Due to the court decision there is no legal reason to remove them
[2015-05-28 10:41:20] <WikiLeaks> Emmy B, re, video, the breakin?
[2015-05-28 11:31:19] <Emmy B> @ WL sorry I don’t understand 🙂
[2015-05-28 12:12:33] <noll> Cables, we know, but there’s no space to question whatever claims MGT made within process, would have to send in (likely ignored) complaint.
[2015-05-28 12:17:11] <noll> Em, um.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXuNa_h804c
[2015-05-28 12:18:37] <noll> – it’s impossible to recommend anything.
[2015-05-28 12:31:39] <noll> (Em, we hv no idea what that means!) Cables, jtlyk we’re free to start MGT/ Steinitz after 31, will be in touch./ also, will Supernerds be –
[2015-05-28 12:32:54] <noll> – be posted, or streams remain up after the show? just dipped in, looks v. good.
[2015-05-28 12:52:51] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, couldn’t access while at work, but very much want to see Supernerds.

[2015-05-28 16:39:55] <LibertarianLibrarian> 🙂
[2015-05-28 16:40:42] <Emmy B> heh
[2015-05-29 07:03:08] <LibertarianLibrarian> Add @ascorbic to WLtrolls list. I’m about to block.
[2015-05-29 09:39:26] <Emmy B> Check out his public lists Jenny, he is an interesting one… I will start another list, for our info and put his name on… next to Heather
[2015-05-29 09:39:42] <Emmy B> brook, and David Allen Green…
[2015-05-29 09:40:05] <Emmy B> I will take a closer look at him over the weekend xx
[2015-05-29 10:15:46] <LibertarianLibrarian> OK! He was spouting their traditional nonsense, but he did stop sooner than I expected – went away on his own. 🙂
[2015-05-30 04:47:09] <noll> can someone else remind Bella not to feed Bolt’s “sorcery” obsessions (we’re tried & failed several times).
[2015-05-30 09:40:31] <WikiLeaks> WikiLeaks is riding high in germany and will continue to for the next few months, so it’s a good time for cases there.
[2015-05-30 09:40:42] <LibertarianLibrarian> Sorcery? Seriously?
[2015-05-30 09:41:55] <WikiLeaks> Not feeding the trolls seems to have worked quite well.
[2015-05-30 09:42:04] <LibertarianLibrarian> That’s awesome! I know SuperNerds was amazing plus the new releases. Hope it means good things for Cable and P’s cases.
[2015-05-30 09:42:46] <WikiLeaks> The combination of WL doing well, and very few engaging with them, seems to have left them moribund.
[2015-05-30 09:43:00] <LibertarianLibrarian> I suspect it’s always good to avoid feeding the trolls, much like alligators or tribbles.
[2015-05-30 09:43:02] <WikiLeaks> So it’s annoying that Bella is feeding some.
[2015-05-30 09:44:39] <LibertarianLibrarian> It’s tough not to avoid responding when someone spouts off idiocy. I shouldn’t have gotten into it with one yesterday but sometimes you’re
[2015-05-30 09:44:48] <LibertarianLibrarian> not sure at first.
[2015-05-30 09:47:08] <LibertarianLibrarian> Some people just have swallowed propaganda and can be reasoned with bit others, not. May take a few tweets to tell the difference.
[2015-05-30 09:47:23] <LibertarianLibrarian> Bit = but
[2015-05-30 09:48:52] <LibertarianLibrarian> Anyway, congrats on SuperNerds and all the recent releases! It’s been great to see so many people picking up on the new data.

[2015-05-31 13:58:10] <LibertarianLibrarian> Don’t know. Sometimes is just takes one RT to get others to copy. I’ve got a bunch of random accounts following me, no idea why.
[2015-05-31 13:59:10] <LibertarianLibrarian> Thought about cleaning them out but then figured I wouldn’t bother. Do need to clean out who I am following at some pt.
[2015-05-31 13:59:43] <LibertarianLibrarian> Some ppl follow just to get their stats up, I think.

[2015-06-01 05:51:18] <LibertarianLibrarian> Considering the source that’s a rather nice compliment for the Senator from Kentucky. LOL
[2015-06-01 17:20:42] <Cabledrum> I’ve just received the written reasons for the judgement on the annulment of the injunction. It says almost nothing.
[2015-06-01 17:20:47] <Cabledrum> A preliminary injunction requires urgency and the only reason for the annulment is the lack of urgency in this case.
[2015-06-01 17:21:04] <Cabledrum> The court has neither judged whether the publication of his photo is a violation of MGT’s rights nor whether he is responsible for FWLF.
[2015-06-01 17:21:16] <Cabledrum> This judgements are deferred until the principal proceedings in October.
[2015-06-01 17:22:08] <LibertarianLibrarian> That makes sense, still good to see his injunction removed.
[2015-06-01 17:23:47] <WikiLeaks> Big day tomorrow for WL. Prepare to fight lots of fun wars.
[2015-06-01 17:43:48] <noll> another one, or big as in Kerry cycling round world apologising? either way, look forward to whatever’s next.
[2015-06-01 17:47:19] <noll> Cables, if it’s no longer deemed urgent – that must indicate court no longer fully believes? we still don’t understand PC verdict, would be
[2015-06-01 17:48:20] <noll> – good to have some kind of overview of that decision at some point/ when poss’.
[2015-06-01 18:00:19] <Cabledrum> MGT falsely claimed that he wasn’t aware of the publication of his photo before January 2015.
[2015-06-01 18:00:22] <Cabledrum> He forgot that he demanded the removal of this photo already in April 2014, by written letter.
[2015-06-01 18:00:27] <Cabledrum> This is the ONLY reason why the court has annulled the injunction.
[2015-06-01 18:00:54] <Cabledrum> PC’s case: I have no update yet. She is still waiting for the written reasons of judgement.
[2015-06-02 01:08:26] <Emmy B> @ WL on the edge of our seat as usual 🙂
[2015-06-02 01:11:11] <Emmy B> @ CD 1. He wants to run u dry of money 2. seek legal advise re fresh publications. MGT’s photo is out there already, job done! 3. we should

[2015-06-02 06:34:19] <noll> – service whistleblowing? if leak comes this way, ‘greed motive’ will be used by adversaries – forever, regardless of whether justified.
[2015-06-02 06:37:23] <noll> – this motive argument will also impact cases (incl. Manning appeal) via enhancing or generating soliciting claims.
[2015-06-02 06:43:32] <WikiLeaks> Yes. But then those questions will become boring and we will announce the next prize and the next one and the next one…
[2015-06-02 06:51:51] <noll> means will also become boring unless accompanied by an end, & then they’re stuck w/ each other. but, if can push leaks to domino a bit?..
[2015-06-02 06:53:12] <noll> it’s risky. but what isn’t.
[2015-06-02 06:53:42] <WikiLeaks> Each prize has a different demographic and campaigns can be started quickly off the back off major stories (e.g torture report).
[2015-06-02 06:54:23] <WikiLeaks> Yes. World wide freedom of the press is closing, so we decided to buck the trend and aggressively push in the other direction.
[2015-06-02 07:25:24] <noll> agree, hatches are being battened down everywhere, one would think there is a storm approaching.

[2015-06-04 06:35:39] <LibertarianLibrarian> That’s always true, HazelP, left, right, or anyone. The specious bombasting is dangerous enough, esp. when public buys into it.

[2015-06-04 07:04:45] <noll> *shame
[2015-06-04 07:07:35] <noll> – & it’s (ironically in this case) usually driven by funding. lancet survey seems, just going on history of these things, to be closer to
[2015-06-04 07:08:23] <noll> – the mark.
[2015-06-04 08:39:36] <LibertarianLibrarian> The reporting of “COI” (Conflict of Interest) in medical and scientific literature is a big issue, particularly the reporting of funding.
[2015-06-04 08:40:55] <LibertarianLibrarian> In most cases, the concern centers around pharmaceutical and biotech company funding and author involvement with the companies.
[2015-06-04 08:42:15] <LibertarianLibrarian> Looking at funding and COI is one of the things I include when teaching how to evaluate the published literature and clinical trials.
[2015-06-04 08:43:30] <LibertarianLibrarian> But there’s paying attention to potential COI and then there’s absurd attacks meant to hurt someone, looks like this case is the latter.
[2015-06-04 08:45:50] <LibertarianLibrarian> Getting government funding may/may not be a conflict, depending on a number of variables. In evaluating study bias, I look for disclosure.
[2015-06-04 08:48:41] <LibertarianLibrarian> Now, you almost always see disclosures required. Some institutions have banned drug company ‘swag’ for doctors and clinical personnel.
[2015-06-04 08:50:04] <LibertarianLibrarian> If you get external funding, honorariums, etc., to give a speech/presentation or other things, most academics have to report it.
[2015-06-04 08:51:29] <LibertarianLibrarian> But I haven’t seen that for government funding, though it’s certainly an issue. I know Julian wrote an interesting article on it years ago.
[2015-06-04 08:52:50] <LibertarianLibrarian> But most US govt agencies funding research require reporting their support and public access to resulting articles. Well, the ‘normal ones’.
[2015-06-04 08:53:53] <LibertarianLibrarian> I’d bet that there’s CIA/NSA/DOD/etc. funding that remains hidden. It’s the NIH/NSF/DOE/CDC/etc. that requires public access & reporting.
[2015-06-04 09:36:10] <noll> Jen, agree re COI points, & yes, US pharma is awful. re non-slanted reporting, here’s crux & Ahmed can’t answer it: http://www.nafeezahmed.com/2015/05/scientific-responsibility-in-counting.html?showComment=1431680486334#c8829234982084531394
[2015-06-04 10:04:31] <noll> whilst on ‘reporting + distortions = propaganda’ topic, would be great if WLP finally sorted out posting policy. https://twitter.com/WikiLeaksParty/status/603910348480053248
[2015-06-04 10:05:16] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, there’s a problem if he can’t show direct funding/influence for specific work. If their disclosures are open then the reader can decide
[2015-06-04 10:07:45] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yeah, they’re not always consistent. But political parties are a nightmare at any time. My last Libertarian Party mtg degenerated into chaos
[2015-06-04 10:11:20] <noll> Jen, he’s missing point entirely? isn’t issue conformity to cosy cliques? & funding – what’s that to you/ you’re group if you’re ostracised?
[2015-06-04 10:16:36] <LibertarianLibrarian> Not quite sure I know what you mean. RE conformity to cliques – that’s a common & sad human behavior. People will swallow a lot to belong.
[2015-06-04 10:18:02] <LibertarianLibrarian> Not sure what funding has to do with being ostracized, except that you can find it hard to get funded if going against accepted norms.
[2015-06-04 10:20:04] <noll> yes, mean that all these groups (IBC etc) operate in closed circles. / completely agree, all the same, would be good if WLP uped their game.
[2015-06-04 10:26:55] <noll> re IBC: bias also socially driven – & when not funded direct, there’s future funding, job, contacts, that exclusive dinner invite etc.
[2015-06-04 10:29:59] <noll> there’s a great story there, but unfortunately (& typically) Ahmed seems to have signed up elsewhere.

[2015-06-04 10:36:44] <Emmy B> @ WL “You are a winner” Well done! this achievement will give hope to many and courage to even more <3
[2015-06-04 10:37:56] <Emmy B> Well I take all that back after chasing that button all around the screen!!!!!! ;-p
[2015-06-04 10:38:51] <Emmy B> and again ;-p
[2015-06-04 10:39:13] <noll> haha
[2015-06-04 13:53:57] <Emmy B> 🙂 should we believe all that we see? 🙂
[2015-06-04 14:23:20] <noll> Wls again dragged into IBC/ Ahmed/ COI conflict: https://archive.is/gy7Rk#selection-9377.0-9481.63
[2015-06-04 14:24:48] <noll> – or maybe not: http://www.usip.org/publications/global-terrorism-after-the-iraq-warhttp://www.usip.org/publications/would-invasion-of-iraq-be-just-war
[2015-06-04 14:28:04] <noll> – to do quick accuracy checks on Ahmed’s work here & in previous ‘Insurge intelligence’ articles – quite a change in quality, COI?
[2015-06-04 14:28:30] <LibertarianLibrarian> LOL – Glad I’m not the only one who chased that button all over the place! 🙂
[2015-06-04 14:31:11] <LibertarianLibrarian> It would take a good bit of work to go through the various articles and check actual funding and policies. Funding doesn’t always = COI.
[2015-06-04 14:32:39] <LibertarianLibrarian> Sometimes it’s just necessity. But it could make a good subject for an objective journalist to track where many of these NGOs get funds.
[2015-06-04 14:33:06] <LibertarianLibrarian> And what influences they are under and which ones bow to those influences and which ones don’t.
[2015-06-04 15:13:21] <noll> w/ COI & journalism – levels of child-like bias/ ignorance/ idiocy on all sides (incl the subject) seems a. beyond absurd & b. never greater
[2015-06-04 15:34:51] <LibertarianLibrarian> There’s always an observer bias of some kind. It’s inescapable. The key is to 1. recognize you have it & 2. Admit/disclose it.
[2015-06-04 15:35:56] <LibertarianLibrarian> And the reader’s responsibility is to read critically and evaluate how much bias and how much influence.
[2015-06-04 15:36:55] <LibertarianLibrarian> That’s why I love Julian’s idea of scientific journalism – making source documents openly available so interpretive stories can be checked.
[2015-06-04 18:03:20] <noll> agree, it one of JA best moments (has a great little Wikipedia entry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_journalism

[2015-06-05 10:36:55] <noll> if copy/ paste page 337/ 8 into Google translate, it’s quite damning of Claes, while at same time no way near as damning as should be.
[2015-06-05 10:48:54] <LibertarianLibrarian> Those two pages didn’t mention him when I looked at them, but he’s certainly mentioned throughout (by using ‘find’).
[2015-06-05 10:49:03] <LibertarianLibrarian> Awesome re the 50%!
[2015-06-05 10:51:04] <noll> sorry, it’s pages 377/ 8.
[2015-06-05 10:51:38] <LibertarianLibrarian> Wow – that’s particularly nasty from Sandra, not that I’m surprised. I blocked her so may not be able to respond which is probably good.
[2015-06-05 10:51:52] <LibertarianLibrarian> I wouldn’t be polite.
[2015-06-05 11:11:05] <M> English summary of Quick report with comments from Anne Ramberg, Thomas Olsson, Claes Borgström https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&artikel=6182834&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter
[2015-06-05 11:25:16] <LibertarianLibrarian> Of course Borgstrom refuses to take responsibility for his failures. Looks like Olsson’s getting plenty of experience cleaning up after him.
[2015-06-05 13:02:19] <WikiLeaks> Emmy, we appreciate the effort, but not helpful to feed the Eckersley troll like that (your anaysis).
[2015-06-05 13:02:54] <WikiLeaks> SE’s article was poorly written, obviously biases, and on a website with no credibility.
[2015-06-05 13:04:10] <WikiLeaks> i.e it didn’t need to be addressed. Now it’s on your website and SE can claim more earnings for her work or otherwise feel like she exists.
[2015-06-05 13:05:22] <WikiLeaks> We have a series of wonderful publications this month that touch on every economic sector of most of the world.
[2015-06-05 13:05:58] <WikiLeaks> So there’s lots to be gained in a positive approach and if you want to whack someone for sport, then we suggest…
[2015-06-05 13:06:45] <WikiLeaks> …those prominent figures who are pro-TISA/TPP, since they’re positional opponents anyway and we might make friends with their enemies.
[2015-06-05 13:07:04] <Emmy B> I agree with your assessment regarding the SE article, it was not my analysis but a friend asked if I could host her article and I accepted.
[2015-06-05 13:07:32] <Emmy B> as she hasn’t got her own blog
[2015-06-05 13:08:18] <WikiLeaks> SE is in the gutter. Tell her to aim higher.
[2015-06-05 13:08:45] <Emmy B> *sigh*
[2015-06-05 13:10:40] <Emmy B> yes, sorry

[2015-06-08 05:52:48] <Emmy B> I will be writing to the London Assembly again, who else should I write to? any ideas?
[2015-06-08 05:54:23] <noll> (you can download FOI PDFs from ‘FOI archive’ at bottom of pages). thanks Em :o) maybe new SNP MPs?
[2015-06-08 05:56:30] <noll> Em, HO will not answer/ give info’ about individual cases, we just asked to make a point.
[2015-06-08 05:59:10] <Emmy B> good idea about SNP, Caroline Lucas too, it is time to do so.
[2015-06-08 06:06:28] <WikiLeaks> If you watch the Trident debate in Parliament, you will see that Alex Salmond cites WikiLeaks as the publisher.
[2015-06-08 06:06:55] <WikiLeaks> That’s important because it means WL is in Salmond’s brain.
[2015-06-08 08:01:42] <Emmy B> I went to the Public gallery at Westminster and listened to that debate. Indeed it was a pleasure to hear A. Salmond attributing WL and
[2015-06-08 08:03:21] <Emmy B> the Scottish Herald for making public McNeilly’s disclosure.
[2015-06-08 08:04:29] <Emmy B> I will write to them. Twitter has its limitations and I have the trolls at my heals. Better to write.
[2015-06-08 10:25:03] <noll> Actions, beginning to look like @carlbildt’s “it’s not allowed” wasn’t only referring to Swe excuses.

[2015-06-08 15:02:40] <LibertarianLibrarian> Graham too. Can’t believe he’s running for President, utter moron. Though he has to fight with Rubio & Santorum for the idiots’ crown.
[2015-06-08 15:03:38] <LibertarianLibrarian> Feinstein is a clear case for term limits on Senators. What are people thinking?
[2015-06-08 15:15:03] <WikiLeaks> Omidyar’s largest ever recorded political donation was to Feinstein.
[2015-06-08 15:16:48] <Emmy B> He plays it seems a very curious game with the ‘new look etc’ but I don’t understand a lot about USpol.

[2015-06-09 10:07:28] <Cabledrum> It roughly stated: When a member of the German parliament reveals a state secret to the public, this is not an illegal act …
[2015-06-09 10:07:31] <Cabledrum> … provided that he intends to prevent a breach of a constitutional law this way
[2015-06-09 10:07:47] <Cabledrum> (Sadly, my English is insufficient for an accurate translation.)
[2015-06-09 10:11:24] <WikiLeaks> Killed in 1968?
[2015-06-09 10:26:00] <Cabledrum> Yes it got deleted in 1968
[2015-06-09 10:29:03] <noll> what happened in ’68?
[2015-06-09 10:32:07] <Cabledrum> It has been mentioned by Mr. Foschepoth at the “Digital Surveillance State” event on Sunday
[2015-06-09 10:33:01] <noll> thanks, will check it out.
[2015-06-09 10:34:33] <Cabledrum> hazel: In 1968, the German Emergency Acts (“Notstandsgesetze”) took place http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Emergency_Acts

[2015-06-10 13:37:47] <noll> IBC/ Lancet argue over the dead – really highlights importance of Manning’s whistleblowing: http://www.medialens.org/23_fg_75_lc/viewtopic.php?t=1619&highlight=
[2015-06-10 15:24:33] <Emmy B> It is great to see straight away Academics on board WL release analysis rather than getting papers report what lobbies & politicians (always
[2015-06-10 15:26:14] <Emmy B> ready with a quote spinning their way) want to project on the public. Good approach in setting the real agenda, also easy for most journos
[2015-06-10 15:26:21] <Emmy B> to report 🙂
[2015-06-10 17:04:30] <Emmy B> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/608786544128688128
[2015-06-10 17:04:46] <Emmy B> @ WL this article is from 2014!!!
[2015-06-10 17:09:28] <Emmy B> Guardian’s latest article is from the 3rd of June covering WL TISA and previous TPP releases http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jun/03/wikileaks-documents-trade-in-services-agreement
[2015-06-10 17:09:59] <Emmy B> They haven’t yet covered Health chapter…I keep looking 🙂
[2015-06-10 17:20:59] <Emmy B> What on Earth is this article about I have no idea it claims WL hosted stuff and then deleted it – disinfo? or a joke http://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/06/the-fake-terrorist-conspiracy-game-that-fooled-people-for-years/
[2015-06-10 17:48:34] <M> It’s about an ‘alternate reality game’ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game
[2015-06-10 17:49:03] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/492419377367887872 As far as the WL stuff goes, it’s bullshit:
[2015-06-11 09:18:10] <Emmy B> It is time for WL to write a cypherpunk volume II I think, there is a lot that is commonly known through the Snowden revelations and it is
[2015-06-11 09:19:24] <Emmy B> important that they come together and made sense of, given voice for the professional bodies legal/medical/political to start realising the
[2015-06-11 09:21:07] <Emmy B> issue/s and the general public too, a book that will verbalise in political speak, in legal speak, social, educational speak where we are &
[2015-06-11 09:21:55] <Emmy B> were we need to go, a lot of latest JA interviews are pointing to such matters… 🙂
[2015-06-11 09:22:33] <Emmy B> (already)
[2015-06-11 09:24:24] <Emmy B> when Teresa May delivers her speeches about anti-terror laws and legalising surveillance… where is the counter narrative? politicians
[2015-06-11 09:25:36] <Emmy B> don’t even have the vocabulary for the counter narrative. In other professions too. Of course, so much to do already… 🙂
[2015-06-11 09:27:12] <Emmy B> and thanks for doing all you’ve done!
[2015-06-11 09:28:53] <WISE Up Action> Em Remember Stand Up for Truth @jrschlosberg mentioned the lack of counter narrative in MSM. How to break through that?
[2015-06-11 09:44:42] <Emmy B> maybe Non 5 eyes countries have more of a chance to be leaders in developing the counter narrative but of course there is both fear
[2015-06-11 09:46:23] <Emmy B> and complicity. Anglo-Saxon pride and a system of clientelism among 5 eyes makes those counties’ MSM complicity a ticket to establishment
[2015-06-11 09:47:49] <Emmy B> status. Difficult to see dissenting will let alone speak, SNP is a hopeful at this precise point, what MSM do they control?
[2015-06-11 09:47:54] <Emmy B> any?
[2015-06-11 09:48:10] <Emmy B> hmm
[2015-06-11 11:51:54] <WikiLeaks> There was only one paper, a Sunday paper, that supported Scottish independence.
[2015-06-11 11:52:09] <WikiLeaks> – and it was in Scotland.
[2015-06-11 11:52:19] <WikiLeaks> A new pro-independence paper has been founded.
[2015-06-11 11:52:33] <WikiLeaks> The other Scottish papers now have to pretend to support Independence.
[2015-06-11 11:57:41] <LibertarianLibrarian> Hopefully the pressure of the people’s demands via voting will facilitate more supportive press for the SNP and independence.
[2015-06-11 11:59:06] <LibertarianLibrarian> I’m rather enjoying watching Rand Paul try to politically capitalize on the worst anti-liberty behaviors of Obama’s Admin (& Clinton)
[2015-06-11 12:01:31] <LibertarianLibrarian> He’s going after the NDAA and interminable detention w/out due process next. Despite some issues I have with him, he’s still pushing…
[2015-06-11 12:02:16] <LibertarianLibrarian> some important issues into public debate, making it tough on the MSM to ignore them. It’s fun to watch them squirm.
[2015-06-11 12:03:16] <LibertarianLibrarian> It’s nice to see a politician ‘making hay’ out of constitutional violations. 🙂
[2015-06-11 12:13:21] <WikiLeaks> Visa blockaded WL, but soft core child porn is just fine http://www.naturistfreedom.com/
[2015-06-11 13:34:38] <WikiLeaks> They would have tried to go all the way. Politically impossible to do anything else.
[2015-06-11 13:35:34] <WikiLeaks> A more interesting question is whether England would have permitted it and how it would have turned formal Scottish independence into..
[2015-06-11 13:35:50] <WikiLeaks> ..a shell through the use of bilateral treaties.
[2015-06-11 13:36:45] <WikiLeaks> There is also a real question about the wisdom of sharing an Island with an aggressive nation 10x your size.
[2015-06-11 13:37:40] <Emmy B> From a Greek and Cyprus perspective (and some 50+ years family experience in AngloEgyptian Sudan) Britain nothing but benign 🙁
[2015-06-11 13:42:05] <Emmy B> Even WWII their ‘assistance’ to Greek resistance was always hampered by their Monarchical agenda (support the Greek King at all costs)
[2015-06-11 13:43:07] <Emmy B> In the end came the betrayal in post war Greece and also in Cyprus. It is colonialism of course which was no different to what was meted
[2015-06-11 13:44:51] <Emmy B> to Ireland, Scotland and even Wales (four years in Cardiff which is so Anglicised still you have a strong Welsh identity).
[2015-06-11 13:53:58] <Emmy B> I don’t think one solution fits all ie Nation states are always best, but the English have dominated the other nations and have been brutal
[2015-06-11 13:55:31] <Emmy B> in doing so, let the others be I say, there are no barbarians at the gate other than ourselves. Thank goodness! 🙂
[2015-06-11 14:10:37] <LibertarianLibrarian> Good points, Emmy.
[2015-06-11 14:11:53] <LibertarianLibrarian> There’s so much history b/w Scotland & England, a lot of it quite bitter. I don’t know if full independence is possible today, but some
[2015-06-11 14:12:08] <LibertarianLibrarian> will always want it.
[2015-06-11 14:14:13] <LibertarianLibrarian> I don’t know how the Scotland – UK relation works relative to US federal – state. Here there is always some tension over State rights.
[2015-06-11 14:15:04] <LibertarianLibrarian> After all, we fought a civil war over that, yes, it was about slavery too, but really it was states rights vs federal govt at core.
[2015-06-11 14:16:33] <LibertarianLibrarian> The 10th Amendment and states’ rights may be much quieter now than before but it’s still an issue, i.e. re Marijuana legalization now.
[2015-06-11 14:17:49] <LibertarianLibrarian> I wonder what the SNP would consider feasible now short of full independence; how much separation would satisfy them and their supporters.
[2015-06-11 14:25:26] <Emmy B> I remember our conversations in Earls Court about US Jenny 🙂 learned a lot including not all higher education or healthcare is private.
[2015-06-11 14:26:21] <Emmy B> Are such matter decided at state level or federal level? and who collects the taxes?
[2015-06-11 14:28:31] <Emmy B> Here in UK all direct and indirect taxes go to central gov with the exception of Council tax (police, local road maint rubish collection)
[2015-06-11 14:29:19] <Emmy B> which goes to the local government (borough/municipality level).
[2015-06-11 14:30:40] <Emmy B> Scotland though gets to administer already how to spend central gov money within Scotland via the devolution agreement.
[2015-06-11 14:33:18] <LibertarianLibrarian> That’s part of the complicated nature of changing something like healthcare or education policy in the US. Each State can make policy.
[2015-06-11 14:34:27] <Emmy B> I see! very difficult then, the Constitution does not mention anything about education for example?
[2015-06-11 14:34:27] <LibertarianLibrarian> You pay federal taxes and in most states you pay state taxes. Some states don’t have income tax, but collect by sales tax, property tax, etc
[2015-06-11 14:34:53] <Emmy B> Indirect tax
[2015-06-11 14:35:27] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, exactly – it doesn’t, and by the 10th Amendment anything not specifically said to be federal responsibility is actual supposed to be
[2015-06-11 14:35:33] <LibertarianLibrarian> in state hands.
[2015-06-11 14:36:26] <Emmy B> And at state level how is each state governed?
[2015-06-11 14:36:40] <LibertarianLibrarian> Some states have tried their own health insurance programs, with varied success and mostly failure. Tennessee’s state health insurance
[2015-06-11 14:37:28] <LibertarianLibrarian> went belly up more than once. Got sued by Hospitals for millions in nonpayment. Mass is supposed to be a bit better, varies.
[2015-06-11 14:38:09] <LibertarianLibrarian> Different states and even more local areas can try out different education approaches to some degree.
[2015-06-11 14:38:46] <Emmy B> such a big country so many states, surely some ‘got it right’ ?
[2015-06-11 14:38:51] <LibertarianLibrarian> The federal govt uses the funds it gives the states to pressure states to go along with federal mandates.
[2015-06-11 14:39:13] <Emmy B> mandates about what?
[2015-06-11 14:39:51] <LibertarianLibrarian> Not many that I know of, problems include lack of funds to pay for it at state level, lack of enough primary care providers, many things.
[2015-06-11 14:41:08] <LibertarianLibrarian> But, for example, when Obamacare went through, states could choose to expand Medicare/Medicaid or not, some did, some didn’t. Some are
[2015-06-11 14:41:23] <LibertarianLibrarian> even considering banning it.
[2015-06-11 14:42:13] <LibertarianLibrarian> One weird example, Arizona refuses to go on daylight savings time so it’s off from rest of country in time for much of the year.
[2015-06-11 14:42:46] <Emmy B> ::-)
[2015-06-11 14:43:19] <Emmy B> their own ‘timezone’ 😀
[2015-06-11 14:43:35] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, exactly. Seriously.
[2015-06-11 14:45:03] <LibertarianLibrarian> It’s not always easy for the fed govt to overrule states, look at Marijuana legalization now. Feds trying to make it stop but failing.
[2015-06-11 14:46:04] <LibertarianLibrarian> I remember big fights b/w states & fed govt over speed limits. Speed limits on highways vary state to state, but years ago fed govt
[2015-06-11 14:46:44] <LibertarianLibrarian> threatened highway funds to states to get nationwide 55 mph. Didn’t last long.
[2015-06-11 14:47:44] <LibertarianLibrarian> NY still has 55 but FL was 70 mostly.
[2015-06-11 14:48:43] <Emmy B> So this is an example of the mandates you were talking about earlier?
[2015-06-11 14:48:43] <LibertarianLibrarian> Seems like silly issues, but permanent tension. So I look at Scotland situation through US lens, need learn more of their perspective.
[2015-06-11 14:48:59] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes.
[2015-06-11 14:50:17] <Emmy B> But, do you have any ‘national’ or ‘ethnic’ issues among states? I know it is all America but are there ethnic distinctions at all?
[2015-06-11 14:51:23] <WISE Up Wales> I suppose we only have to look to Ireland to see just how low Brits will stoop to hinder independence. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYF5_z3zmPw&feature=youtu.be
[2015-06-11 14:52:08] <LibertarianLibrarian> It’s not really ethnic differences but cultural differences, except in certain places. Some places like south florida, South Cali, South Tx
[2015-06-11 14:53:29] <LibertarianLibrarian> have strong Mexican, latin/so American influences. And ethnic groups settled in certain places. Like Swedes and Norwegians in Wisconsin
[2015-06-11 14:55:03] <LibertarianLibrarian> Dutch communities in Iowa, parts of NY & PA. English ‘pilgrim’ influences in New England. But more, the states and regions have unique
[2015-06-11 14:56:16] <LibertarianLibrarian> character. The Eastern South is very different from the Western South from New England from the Midwest from the far west, then Cal, OR, WA
[2015-06-11 14:56:30] <LibertarianLibrarian> In Pacific northwest different.
[2015-06-11 14:57:59] <LibertarianLibrarian> Accents, foods, pace of life, primary religions, attitudes, etc change. Remember US is as big as or bigger than Europe.
[2015-06-11 14:59:46] <LibertarianLibrarian> I think we have a problem, due to size, of the lowest common denominator getting nationally elected. Hard to escape huge mass media at that
[2015-06-11 14:59:50] <LibertarianLibrarian> stage.
[2015-06-11 15:00:04] <Emmy B> We keep talking about US this US that, really, we mean the federal gov ie the politicians that govern. Still, the represent the people.
[2015-06-11 15:00:50] <LibertarianLibrarian> Very difficult to mass appeal across so many varied cultures and attitudes and belief systems.
[2015-06-11 15:01:18] <LibertarianLibrarian> So gets watered down to mass stupidity.
[2015-06-11 15:01:53] <LibertarianLibrarian> But that’s why state and local govts have as much power as they do.
[2015-06-11 15:03:04] <LibertarianLibrarian> Even the original 13 were hesitant to give up states’ rights, thus 10th Amendment.
[2015-06-11 15:04:00] <LibertarianLibrarian> Anyway, this was today’s lesson in Americana. For next time… ;D
[2015-06-11 15:05:45] <Emmy B> 🙂 thank you Jenny, we have learned something new today 🙂 x
[2015-06-11 15:07:06] <LibertarianLibrarian> Teach me more about the UK and other countries. I wish I could afford to travel more.
[2015-06-11 15:07:10] <LibertarianLibrarian> 🙂
[2015-06-11 15:08:39] <Emmy B> Well <3 (I am greek – heh) but genny (wales) shared an excellent video back there really worth watching also the Logan symposium video
[2015-06-11 15:09:01] <Emmy B> (dec 2014) remember we had a stall for Chelsea there 🙂 https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=10&v=o9EFC42qTb0
[2015-06-11 15:09:44] <Emmy B> About Northern Ireland
[2015-06-11 15:10:21] <Emmy B> and to tight it all in with Greece (;-p)….
[2015-06-11 15:10:55] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, I’m watching a lot of YouTube vids, I’m also a big fan of British TV drama, mystery and sci-fi. I actually do watch more UK TV than US.
[2015-06-11 15:12:23] <LibertarianLibrarian> Well, I’m off work and can home and get dinner. Have a good night, I may pop back on later when y’all should be sound asleep. 🙂
[2015-06-11 15:13:58] <Emmy B> bye bye Jenny! xxx have a good day at work!!!

[2015-06-11 15:16:10] <Emmy B> Boer war, Russia, Northern Ireland, Greece, and Palestine … British colonial pedigree
[2015-06-11 16:26:27] <noll> http://i.guim.co.uk/static/w-940/h–/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434050481208/8e305de7-1b02-4d84-a3ee-bd8a002a76f6-620×423.jpeg
[2015-06-11 16:52:19] <noll> Em, you forget England was a slave state ruled by Norse of Northern France: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normans#Conquests_and_military_offensives
[2015-06-11 17:01:34] <noll> – colonialism, but cold war conflict which if lost wld hv spread to Italy & beyond. & as you know, regardless of outside interests, Greek –
[2015-06-11 17:02:22] <noll> polarization goes back to dawn of history.
[2015-06-11 18:16:10] <noll> Wales, as w/ Falklands, Gibraltar it’s a matter of democracy/ self-determination: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Northern_Ireland#/media/File:Northern_Ireland_Life_and_Times_Survey_constitutional_preference.pnghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination
[2015-06-11 18:28:22] <noll> re Ireland – race for independence steppingstone was lost & nationalist patience long gone: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Home_Rule_movement#Home_Rule_billshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Ireland_Act_1914#The_Bill
[2015-06-11 18:32:58] <noll> Em, simplifications from left or right/ east or western lens are equally wrong. the Boer war started by a lunatic governor. Russia, pure –
[2015-06-11 18:41:29] <noll> imperialism, NI b/c no choice, Greece b/c look at post-war map, Palestine b/c an imperial era is just that, &: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Future_of_Palestine
[2015-06-11 18:44:55] <noll> re distorted lens, it’d be interesting to hear what anyone think would have occurred if NATO hadn’t intervened in Libya? one side usually
[2015-06-11 18:52:45] <noll> – has nothing to say after their self-interested bombing panacea failed, the other side just wishes the war away & lies about causalities.
[2015-06-12 06:51:53] <WikiLeaks> Scotland will pal up with US post independence, like Ireland. They need a counter-weight to England.
[2015-06-12 07:08:16] <LibertarianLibrarian> Is there a reasonable counterweight available for Scotland in today’s world? Not sure Russia or China would be even within possibility.
[2015-06-12 07:09:33] <LibertarianLibrarian> The best I see worldwide is the Latin American countries starting to stand together. But is such available to Scotland?
[2015-06-12 07:10:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> Of course, on my end, I’d like to see the US draw way back on its foreign involvement. Not isolationist, but get out of current insanity.
[2015-06-12 09:19:15] <Emmy B> US post war Policy of strengthening the most radical islamists (from Afghanistan to Saudi Arabia) to counteract first USSR then Russia is
[2015-06-12 09:20:41] <Emmy B> so short sighted and so distractive, long term to Western civilisation is at least idiotic. Using Nato in this manner disables its function
[2015-06-12 09:22:03] <Emmy B> as an alliance of even the pretence of a common interest.
[2015-06-12 09:25:24] <Emmy B> What happened in the Ukraine and West’s support to modern day European fascism (our own demon) though is even more dangerous and idiotic.
[2015-06-12 09:27:28] <Emmy B> I am sorry to be so negative but my view is that US policy has been extremely successful in creating chaos they cannot control.
[2015-06-12 09:28:14] <Emmy B> They did not ‘win’ in Afghanistan nor in Iraq, despite the billions spent and the military effort. All they managed to do is destroy destroy
[2015-06-12 09:34:46] <Emmy B> Personally I don’t see Russia as a threat, post USSR they have no ambition or they would not have let first the Balkans, then rest East E.
[2015-06-12 09:36:38] <Emmy B> let go without a fight or even a ‘new negotiated understanding’ a new Yalta so to speak, a tactical withdrawal understanding, something to
[2015-06-12 09:36:44] <Emmy B> fall back to.
[2015-06-12 10:15:50] <LibertarianLibrarian> I agree with you, Emmy. Bush and Obama’s policies in the Middle East & Ukraine (and other places) has been not just foolish but outright
[2015-06-12 10:16:02] <LibertarianLibrarian> dangerous and counterproductive.
[2015-06-12 10:17:47] <LibertarianLibrarian> I’m afraid they’ve created such a large power infrastructure built around these useless, endless wars and warmongering that it’s going to
[2015-06-12 10:18:16] <LibertarianLibrarian> be difficult for the US to get out of it, regardless of who is President.
[2015-06-12 10:19:42] <LibertarianLibrarian> Unless we get someone very unusually courageous and independent. Or some real internal pressure – but, typically, foreign ‘evils’ are
[2015-06-12 10:20:35] <LibertarianLibrarian> used to keep internal controls in place, thus the anti-Muslim terror phobia and the anti-Russia propaganda.
[2015-06-12 10:21:16] <LibertarianLibrarian> UK is doing it too, as are other EU nations.
[2015-06-12 11:00:58] <Emmy B> It is true, very hard to develop an alternative.
[2015-06-12 18:55:24] <noll> Em, it goes unreported but *everyone knows the Ukraine separatists are as equally fascistic as pro-EUs. if you think Putin’s Russia is not –
[2015-06-12 18:58:04] <noll> – imperialistic, then explain North Caucasus campaigns (& a casus belli which earned a death sentence for reporting on) – that’s why it’s –
[2015-06-12 18:59:58] <noll> – missing from Cablegate? we’re not excusing US/ NATO at all. there was no reason to invade Afghanistan, Iraq, & expansion east is insane.
[2015-06-12 19:03:54] <noll> anti-Russian propaganda shows intent, & Russian propaganda illustrates failures. our points concern scientific journalism/ history –
[2015-06-12 19:06:14] <WikiLeaks> Russia has minor imperialistic goals in its near abroad. But it’s economy is considerably smaller than that of Italy…
[2015-06-12 19:06:56] <noll> – invented by Thucydides, w/o which we are lost? it’s important to flag balance, interests of today’s four empires. Wls, we agree, & yet –
[2015-06-12 19:07:18] <WikiLeaks> ..It on the defensive and terrified as the the US produces its next generation weapons and enroaches inexorably.
[2015-06-12 19:08:39] <WikiLeaks> The greatest landmass in the world with an economy the size of italy and borders with a great many states — including a massive China.
[2015-06-12 19:08:55] <noll> – Hitler made just that mistake. Russia is a behemoth, something that US etc seem // what can you say? – historically illiterate of.
[2015-06-12 19:09:09] <WikiLeaks> It runs an independent foreign policy and its arms sales are the only thing that keep a semblance of independence for smaller states.
[2015-06-12 19:09:45] <WikiLeaks> Russia is absolutely terrified.
[2015-06-12 19:12:00] <WikiLeaks> Kalingrad, Crimea, and its only foreign naval base, Syria are all under threat and are not protected by Russia’s strategic depth.
[2015-06-12 19:12:47] <WikiLeaks> Meanwhile the US hacks the hell out of it, and attempts to forment an orange revolution in an explicitly stated policy of regime change.
[2015-06-12 19:14:19] <WikiLeaks> Consequently the Kremlin is deeply paranoid of everyone, including foreign funded NGO’s and invading “western” cultural practices, like gays
[2015-06-12 19:15:20] <WikiLeaks> and the internet. That pushes it to become authoritarian, because it thinks it may be overthrown by US subversion, meanwhile opportunists..
[2015-06-12 19:15:51] <WikiLeaks> …within Russia play on Kremlin fears for their own advancement and power consolidation.
[2015-06-12 19:18:50] <noll> we agree, w/ all of that, Victoria Nuland intercepts show the depth of US meddling. & yet greatest danger to Kremlin & its satellites is –
[2015-06-12 19:18:59] <WikiLeaks> US next generation weapons are serious advancements. It’s play in Ukraine was in Russia’s sister country, and so the Russian ruling class…
[2015-06-12 19:19:14] <WikiLeaks> are terrified the same thing could happen to them.
[2015-06-12 19:20:49] <noll> – as always velvet revolutions, b/c who would want to remain w/i that sphere, it’s a goldmine that will slowly erode they’re influence –
[2015-06-12 19:22:39] <noll> & power. w/o huge reform, closing that door, they should be concerned. but, as you say, they’re trapped? western ‘reforms’ = weakness,
[2015-06-12 19:24:54] <noll> – a white flag, intolerable to reactionaries. if west pushes at the weakness – and they push back, as they both are – there lies the danger.
[2015-06-12 19:30:10] <noll> antidote is another round of glasnost/ perestroika, but it’s politically inconceivable, mostly thanks to US pressure providing an exit.
[2015-06-12 19:32:50] <WikiLeaks> Exactly.
[2015-06-12 19:33:21] <WikiLeaks> And unity with China is very dangerous, also.
[2015-06-12 19:34:58] <WikiLeaks> 10x the population, 7x the GDP, right up against its exposed south eastern flank.
[2015-06-12 19:37:22] <noll> pact b/w Russia/ China? they both share achilles heel. w/ China, it’s a nightmare in waiting. US should be extraordinarily careful.. but.
[2015-06-12 19:39:34] <noll> that’s not likely: http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d0d6bc1a-fafa-11e4-9aed-00144feab7de.html#axzz3cuEhD5PU
[2015-06-12 19:44:03] <noll> interesting that china has pre-emptively constructed ready made flash point w/ south seas islands, will US/ regional allies take hint? no.
[2015-06-12 19:45:36] <noll> & just imagine another GW Bush pondering any of this.
[2015-06-12 19:54:09] <noll> re costs, we’ve just seen ‘Kajaki’ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajaki_(film)
[2015-06-12 19:56:03] <noll> – & could be set anywhere, involving anyone.
[2015-06-13 04:22:33] <Emmy B> “But it’s economy is considerably smaller than that of Italy…” Didn’t know that, what an eye opener.
[2015-06-13 04:28:00] <Emmy B> In ’95, not long after Glastnost, Perestroika I was working for an AngloRussian shipping company, bringing containerised traffic (consumer
[2015-06-13 04:29:41] <Emmy B> goods) Froem Western Europe to St Petersburg and bringing back metals for (mainly) Steinweg in Rotterdam. This was a reflection of Russian
[2015-06-13 04:30:30] <Emmy B> economy, based on trading commodities ie not sophisticated.
[2015-06-13 04:31:43] <Emmy B> The firm also shipped ‘project cargo’ into Russia, mainly Western manufactured equipment for the gas extraction Russian industries as far
[2015-06-13 04:32:48] <Emmy B> as Siberia and Novosibirsk, generally the energy sector. It was all foreign firms shipping the goods into Russia. I saw then as I see now
[2015-06-13 04:33:50] <Emmy B> the West going after the Russian resources. So now all this US bla bla ‘Europe must be independent of Russia from its energy needs’ it is a
[2015-06-13 04:34:40] <Emmy B> big lie in a way because it was the West that immediately went in to develop this sector. Sadly, I think this anti-Russian rhetoric is not
[2015-06-13 04:37:14] <Emmy B> different than building up a case for the eventual control of Russian resources. German Banks were from the start investing heavily &
[2015-06-13 04:38:32] <Emmy B> building transport infrastructure ie Berlin- Moscow direct rail link etc. So it has been a steady Western reach out to get to Russia market
[2015-06-13 04:39:07] <Emmy B> and resources from West’s financial centres.
[2015-06-13 10:25:22] <Emmy B> @ WL <3 You did it again ! 🙂
[2015-06-13 10:29:49] <LibertarianLibrarian> That fear from Russia has been around for awhile. My sister was there in the Peace Corps when the Russians threw out the Peace Corps,
[2015-06-13 10:29:58] <LibertarianLibrarian> She had to come home early.
[2015-06-13 10:31:19] <LibertarianLibrarian> My personal fears are supporting the rise of fascism in Ukraine and similar places in a foolish use of Russia as an enemy to stir fear in US
[2015-06-13 10:31:42] <LibertarianLibrarian> citizens to keep them from rising up against problems at home.
[2015-06-13 10:32:17] <WikiLeaks> Peace Corps is perfectly nasty at its core. It has its own cable system, complete with classifications and uses the same layout as State.
[2015-06-13 10:32:32] <LibertarianLibrarian> And the use of China as another boogeyman to get us into yet another war or cold war. That would be the worst thing .
[2015-06-13 10:32:57] <Emmy B> I have no idea what peace corps is, looking up now…
[2015-06-13 10:33:33] <LibertarianLibrarian> My parents were both peace corps volunteers and they took their work in Africa in the 60s seriously – my Mom was a nurse. They tried to do
[2015-06-13 10:33:41] <LibertarianLibrarian> good things.
[2015-06-13 10:34:41] <LibertarianLibrarian> A lot of the volunteers really want to help. But I can believe high levels are corruptible.
[2015-06-13 10:35:16] <WikiLeaks> https://search.wikileaks.org/?s=1&q=%22peace+corps%22#results
[2015-06-13 10:35:35] <WikiLeaks> It’s used as cover for CIA etc also.
[2015-06-13 10:36:20] <LibertarianLibrarian> Emmy – peace corps send volunteers around the world to provide help, training, education, medical care. Most volunteers really want to help.
[2015-06-13 10:37:11] <Emmy B> Thank you all, reading now…
[2015-06-13 10:38:14] <LibertarianLibrarian> I grew up on my parents’ stories of West Africa and the amazing people they met there.
[2015-06-13 10:39:12] <LibertarianLibrarian> The same true of my parents’ peace corps friends. It’s very disheartening to hear it’s been misused by the USG.
[2015-06-13 10:40:12] <Emmy B> Very interesting…
[2015-06-13 10:41:18] <LibertarianLibrarian> I nearly volunteered myself coming out of college but wanted to get my PhD, which I never quite finished in the end.
[2015-06-13 10:41:49] <Emmy B> From a time perspective, Before Peace Corps type org, it was churches who played such role in spreading culture/religion influence in Africa
[2015-06-13 10:43:18] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, and churches still do a lot of that.
[2015-06-13 10:43:27] <Emmy B> My great grandad as building contractor built UK gov offices in Chartum (Sudan) & US Christian missions in South Sudan in 30’s 40’s.
[2015-06-13 10:43:40] <WikiLeaks> Yes. Peace Corps was a brilliant, if evil idea.
[2015-06-13 10:44:53] <Emmy B> I guess it can sit above religious obstacles ie penetrate islamic African countries where a Christina mission would not have much chance…
[2015-06-13 10:44:54] <LibertarianLibrarian> Damn, it makes me angry that they misappropriated the good work and true caring of people like my parents and so many of the volunteers.
[2015-06-13 10:46:51] <WikiLeaks> It’s not like some of the work wasn’t useful, but yes, State uses Peace Corps as a means of public diplomacy to calm irate populations.
[2015-06-13 10:47:00] <LibertarianLibrarian> It’s a weird sort of balance, do you take good work that comes with religious evangelism or risk infiltration of secular volunteers w/ govt.
[2015-06-13 10:47:36] <WikiLeaks> Much the same thing.
[2015-06-13 10:48:49] <Emmy B> The missions did good work offering education and health care but also created cultural alienation & dependence of locals from the europeans
[2015-06-13 10:49:11] <WikiLeaks> Duel agenda in both cases. “Do gooding” opens the door, but coversion is the main game.
[2015-06-13 10:49:11] <Emmy B> for work as well as ‘society’.
[2015-06-13 10:51:42] <LibertarianLibrarian> For most volunteers it was purely about the doing good. It was for my parents and their friends. My Mom was a nurse, provided health care
[2015-06-13 10:52:59] <LibertarianLibrarian> She took a lot back with her, used to carry me like the African women did their babies. Taught us Swahili. Made sure we understood
[2015-06-13 10:53:28] <LibertarianLibrarian> people everywhere had value.
[2015-06-13 10:53:52] <Emmy B> “like the African women did their babies.” how sweet 🙂
[2015-06-13 10:54:07] <LibertarianLibrarian> But my parents were 60s hippy types.
[2015-06-13 10:55:53] <LibertarianLibrarian> She wrapped me up on her back with African robes, supposed to make baby feel safe and feel mother’s heart beat.
[2015-06-13 10:57:09] <Emmy B> They would have loved their experience then and took a lot out if it. What a difference a few decades make. My family settled in Africa in
[2015-06-13 10:58:28] <Emmy B> 1913 and left in late 50’s early 60’s I think, very very different attitudes but my mum describes herself as a white African so…
[2015-06-13 10:58:40] <Emmy B> aww!
[2015-06-13 10:59:07] <Emmy B> Jenny, did your parents make local friends?
[2015-06-13 10:59:24] <LibertarianLibrarian> That’s interesting, but yes, generations differ a lot.
[2015-06-13 11:00:28] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, my Mom used to talk about the girl next door, young preteen who spoke 7 languages fluently. And about the Masai people & how dignified
[2015-06-13 11:00:36] <LibertarianLibrarian> they were.
[2015-06-13 11:02:13] <LibertarianLibrarian> I was more a child of the 80s and rebelled against what I thought was my parents’ sappy liberalism. They meant well but I thought they were
[2015-06-13 11:03:50] <LibertarianLibrarian> Full of it. LOL. Typical enough. 😀
[2015-06-13 11:04:37] <LibertarianLibrarian> Anyway, sad to hear Peace Corps misused. It meant a lot to my family.
[2015-06-13 11:06:02] <Emmy B> 😀 I think we owe a lot to that generation Jenny as far as HR and civil liberties are concerned. Whether they lived up to their own
[2015-06-13 11:06:56] <Emmy B> standards is another matter if I am permitted to say so, but created a horizon for us, that still today (drowning in consumerism) provides
[2015-06-13 11:07:04] <Emmy B> a focus, a direction.
[2015-06-13 11:08:14] <Emmy B> But going back to Peace Corps, I think it is fair to say, once an institution is established with state backing and resources it is very
[2015-06-13 11:08:47] <Emmy B> easy to divert its primary function away from its apparent objective.
[2015-06-13 11:10:01] <Emmy B> I will read a bit more about Peace Corps, thanks for bringing it up 🙂
[2015-06-13 11:10:03] <LibertarianLibrarian> Oh yes, they did do a lot of good. I got frustrated with parts of it that were illogical or overdone, like feminism that turns into hatred
[2015-06-13 11:10:26] <LibertarianLibrarian> Or constant whining excuse for failure.
[2015-06-13 11:11:27] <LibertarianLibrarian> Or in my case, constant pressure to succeed professionally. Parents tend to try to make up what they felt they didn’t have thru their kids.
[2015-06-13 11:11:43] <LibertarianLibrarian> Made me hate feminism.
[2015-06-13 11:12:07] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, the peace corps is an interesting topic.
[2015-06-13 11:12:57] <LibertarianLibrarian> And anyway, world’s always moving on and growing up reminds you of what your parents did right as well as wrong.
[2015-06-13 11:13:01] <LibertarianLibrarian> 🙂
[2015-06-13 11:13:11] <Emmy B> 🙂
[2015-06-13 11:13:22] <Emmy B> yes
[2015-06-13 11:15:09] <LibertarianLibrarian> You are right about organizations like the Peace Corps. Sadly ripe for misuse and diversion. That’s why I’m very cautious of charities.
[2015-06-13 11:16:45] <Emmy B> oh http://www.peacecorps.gov/opm-cybersecurity-incident/
[2015-06-13 11:24:26] <Emmy B> YMCA seems more benign

[2015-06-13 19:28:44] <WikiLeaks> “The CIA employee will inform you if and when you have been cleared by the Peace Corps to apply for employment with the Peace Corps.”
[2015-06-13 19:32:12] <WikiLeaks> It’s in knots trying to resolve its own contridictions: to avoid scandals re: CIA infiltration but at the same time, to enable it.

[2015-06-15 07:49:21] <noll> perhaps this has gone so sideways they’re will be no follow-up (which could also involve attacking SH/ Wls).

[2015-06-15 11:06:16] <Emmy B> and many thanks to everyone for sharing all the info links 🙂

[2015-06-15 13:05:57] <Emmy B> Are they going to procrastinate on technicalities?
[2015-06-15 13:13:43] <noll> MLA sent 1 June, things shouldn’t complex – but if Ny waits till near her 31 July deadline, will have a 13 day failure excuse – & blame JA.
[2015-06-15 13:16:34] <Emmy B> Honest to god one day we must know what has happened with this case, the politics, the interference.
[2015-06-15 13:16:44] <Emmy B> so unfair
[2015-06-15 15:44:45] <LibertarianLibrarian> It’s pure insanity. I’m suspicious Ny wants to let it die on statute of limitations so she doesn’t have to produce exculpatory evidence
[2015-06-15 15:45:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> or get embarrassed by being either unable to make charges or getting taken to pieces in court.
[2015-06-15 15:47:11] <LibertarianLibrarian> Leaves JA without chance to see and release exculpatory evidence or to prove his innocence, so he’s left without way to clear his name fully
[2015-06-15 15:48:13] <LibertarianLibrarian> And he’s still stuck b/c of US hidden indictment and UK threat to arrest regardless.
[2015-06-15 15:48:52] <LibertarianLibrarian> Infuriating! Wishing for a way to sneak him out to Ecuador.
[2015-06-15 15:49:23] <LibertarianLibrarian> Too bad he doesn’t fit in a diplomatic bag. 😛

[2015-06-17 07:55:47] <Emmy B> The hypocrisy….
[2015-06-17 08:01:22] <Emmy B> Re Russian sanctions, Syriza intervention avoided expansion of sanctions further back in Feb. They do not have to power to cancel existing
[2015-06-17 08:02:24] <Emmy B> sanctions which will be prolonged as long as the powers to be wish. Gr/Syriza-Anel position is against sanctions in general as non effective
[2015-06-17 08:02:32] <Emmy B> counterproductive.
[2015-06-17 08:03:35] <Emmy B> The other two elements of foreign policy re issue is: 1. 100,000 Greek origin ppl in Mariupoli and their safety, 2. the counter sanctions by

[2015-06-17 08:05:23] <Emmy B> you can imagine the impossible diplomatic situation for GR

[2015-06-17 08:34:03] <noll> Em, agree, GR is canary for so much atm. it’s *own export/ people’s interests vs Troika/ US interests – ‘do as we say or else’. it’s awful.

[2015-06-17 09:21:06] <LibertarianLibrarian> That is interesting. That’s a common problem, reducing high complexity to simplistic examples, esp biased ones. Not that reducing complexity
[2015-06-17 09:22:20] <LibertarianLibrarian> is always bad, but large nations are always a huge mixture of people, cultures, policies… often one part of the govt doesn’t know another

[2015-06-17 11:18:54] <noll> are we reading that right (it’s incredibly muddled) – that in effect there is a 90 day time limit on executing the warrant?
[2015-06-17 11:27:39] <WikiLeaks> It’s muddled, but one should look at the enabling legislation in the UK. The Framework text can only be used to resolve ambiguities.
[2015-06-17 11:49:58] <Emmy B> If it was all supposed a secret about prosecutor coming to question JA at embassy how is it Expressen journo Chris was outside the embassy
[2015-06-17 11:50:27] <Emmy B> asking questions from the vigil ppl? how did he know to come?
[2015-06-17 11:51:25] <Emmy B> it seems someone from the prosecutors office is leaking info selectively to Expressen
[2015-06-17 12:04:40] <noll> looks like 90 time limit is completely ignored by Extradition Act: https://archive.is/ykkia#selection-809.1-815.339

[2015-06-17 14:23:47] <Emmy B> Well the ‘tor is US navy funded thus unsafe’ perspective has been popular among a certain circle including him.
[2015-06-17 14:23:56] <Emmy B> He is just adding to the mythology?
[2015-06-17 14:24:08] <Emmy B> He wants a dig

[2015-06-17 16:26:17] <LibertarianLibrarian> How can anyone believe her or justify her?
[2015-06-17 16:27:41] <LibertarianLibrarian> Wish I could be more proactive helping right now, but I’ll be in hospital next Tues – Thurs having my cardiac surgery. Trying to get work
[2015-06-17 16:28:03] <LibertarianLibrarian> and etc. in order by then.

[2015-06-17 16:29:03] <LibertarianLibrarian> End of next week, I’ll probably be online a lot and bored in recovery, so I can do stuff then if needed

[2015-06-17 16:52:59] <noll> & why lie about that? it’s completely pointless. as though lying has become a pathological compulsion. must be a fun office.
[2015-06-17 17:08:22] <WISE Up Action> It’s the wind up. The ‘can’t confirm or deny’ of the security services. Plus it was technically still a ‘prospective appointment’

[2015-06-17 17:10:33] <LibertarianLibrarian> You’re right, the Guardian has become astonishingly corrupt. I’ve seen places like that, usually it’s terrible leadership, top down paranoia
[2015-06-17 17:11:12] <LibertarianLibrarian> People compete for favor & lie, whisper, gossip, and backstab.
[2015-06-17 17:13:09] <LibertarianLibrarian> I also can’t imagine what Ny’s office is like. How many excuses? How embarrassing.

[2015-06-18 10:56:17] <Emmy B> A close call
[2015-06-18 10:58:47] <WikiLeaks> Senate will not vote against.
[2015-06-18 10:59:00] <WikiLeaks> Not unless we publish the remaining chapters before it votes.
[2015-06-18 11:03:00] <LibertarianLibrarian> Or one of the Sens running for President decides to make trouble. Wonder if Rand Paul would make a stink – he seems to be against it.

[2015-06-18 13:53:19] <WikiLeaks> The issue is, he is trolling people she talks to, e.g like the tory MP, because she talks to them.
[2015-06-18 13:53:30] <Emmy B> but he sees all my tweets anyway I don’t know how and within minutes he is on my threads

[2015-06-18 13:55:44] <WikiLeaks> He won’t know the new name. And the blonde–studies show attractive women as icons open up resistant social groups of men, such as MPs.
[2015-06-18 13:56:28] <WikiLeaks> Or just create a new account to do this.
[2015-06-18 13:58:02] <Emmy B> hahahaha
[2015-06-18 13:59:25] <Emmy B> my problem…I don’t want to pretend to be other than I am…very limiting I know
[2015-06-18 14:00:36] <Emmy B> but anyway a good idea for future campaigns.
[2015-06-18 14:01:05] <WikiLeaks> Pick a dead actress if you want plausible deniability, where the image represents a statement, rather than a person.

[2015-06-23 18:20:10] <LibertarianLibrarian> Wow, I’ve missed a lot. Congrats on the excellent new releases! I’m between days in hospital – back in tomorrow for an overnight.
[2015-06-23 18:21:28] <LibertarianLibrarian> Then hopefully done and well. And I can catch up.
[2015-06-23 18:22:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> Awesome to see the Saudi cables come out – that’s fantastic to get real info on our so-called allies. And wow re the French Presidents!
[2015-06-23 18:39:27] <noll> Jen, hope all’s going well :o) is this 1st NSA cable leak!? yet again – amazing work, Gaelic Rushmore! next up?! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pm9P2xjmBY
[2015-06-23 19:12:18] <LibertarianLibrarian> Thanks. 1/3 through and ok so far. I think I just killed my RT’ing limit for today catching up.

[2015-06-24 12:17:48] <Emmy B> Is the Guardian speaking to special branch over the latest release? I might ask 🙂
[2015-06-24 12:28:34] <WISE Up Action> ‘Developed’ is a bit nasty. Plus:Associates of Snowden have said that they believe he deliberately avoided giving sensitive US documents to
[2015-06-24 12:28:40] <WISE Up Action> Assange
[2015-06-24 12:30:29] <WikiLeaks> It’s Hosenball.
[2015-06-24 12:31:51] <WikiLeaks> We were involved in having him retrenched from Newsweek his reporting was so bad. We celebrated this victory only to find him at Reuters.
[2015-06-24 12:31:57] <WISE Up Action> Aha
[2015-06-24 12:32:28] <WikiLeaks> He does have close contacts to US intelligence, but then he also invents.

[2015-06-26 07:25:09] <noll> Correa’s reform (35 up to 47.5%) definitely on high side of norms: https://webforms.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/2013-international-estate-and-inheritance-tax-guide/$FILE/2013-international-estate-and-inheritance-tax-guide.pdf
[2015-06-26 07:28:36] <noll> questions re stability – whether up-mid/ mid class consider themselves next/ view changes as political attack on power base. Correa calls
[2015-06-26 07:34:00] <noll> – on coup narrative, but he’s certainly up for a fight – nothing gradual to soften opposition. so, is it ‘soft coup’ or ‘coup bait’?
[2015-06-26 08:20:44] <noll> https://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/NSCAP_Accredited_Announcement.pdf
[2015-06-26 08:35:22] <WikiLeaks> Correa’s trying to push family holdings into limited by share companies as their more flexible and to hit dynasties. The tax is 2% for <35k
[2015-06-26 08:36:32] <WikiLeaks> But it has galvanized the rich and the “rich as soon as my relative dies” lot.
[2015-06-26 08:37:17] <WikiLeaks> They’ve then pushed this into the media vehicles they control and presented it as a general attack on the family.
[2015-06-26 08:37:56] <WikiLeaks> Then attached this to other Correa irritants.
[2015-06-26 08:38:27] <WikiLeaks> Pope is visiting in a week so they know they only have a week to make it work as the Pope will be a calmer.
[2015-06-26 09:14:35] <noll> UK has 40% & one threshold (similar level to Ecu’s high band) w/ offsetting via charity, Ecu offsetting via shares is good re dynasties, –
[2015-06-26 09:22:18] <noll> – guess it’s question of best time to take those interests on, & now is the best time. & yes, Pope visit could help.

[2015-06-26 13:14:17] <Emmy B> Greek Parliamentary commission on “The Athens Affair” and “Pythia I” (assassination plan for Kostas Karamanlis whilst PM) has completed
[2015-06-26 13:14:41] <Emmy B> its work and the file passed on to judicial authority.

[2015-06-26 13:15:35] <Emmy B> WikiLeaks Cables used by the commission to put context historical & diplomatic understanding to the story.
[2015-06-26 13:16:06] <Emmy B> worth the read : http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=el&u=http://news.in.gr/greece/article/%3Faid%3D1500008036&prev=search
[2015-06-26 13:16:29] <Emmy B> Original Greek http://news.in.gr/greece/article/?aid=1500008036
[2015-06-26 13:18:12] <Emmy B> this story will be around for many days, I will summarise findings when I get a chance. Other than the WL press article I co-wrote
[2015-06-26 13:19:02] <Emmy B> there have not been much published on the story since the well known ‘The Athens Affair” article published by Privacy International all
[2015-06-26 13:19:28] <Emmy B> those years ago, now I think the story will be reported by the international press.
[2015-06-26 13:21:02] <Emmy B> I just saw the WL tweet on the story, many thanks for picking up the story, really important to get to the truth and the bottom of matter
[2015-06-26 13:21:56] <Emmy B> The particular PM resigned early before the conclusion of his term and it is rumoured as a result of the pressures on him and that plot.
[2015-06-26 13:23:11] <Emmy B> The present gov coalition in Greece contains the minority partner ANEL, a splinter from the traditional right wing party New Democracy.
[2015-06-26 13:24:00] <Emmy B> Despite his splitting off, he remains close to the Karamanlis fraction of the New Democracy party (now headed by Samaras)
[2015-06-26 13:24:56] <Emmy B> The current President of democracy is also from the Karamanlis fraction (a deal brokered by ANEL)
[2015-06-26 13:25:44] <Emmy B> I will be very much surprised if they let this story go away any time soon. In particular considering the current gov’s position towards
[2015-06-26 13:25:57] <Emmy B> energy co-operation with Russia
[2015-06-26 13:26:59] <Emmy B> which rings a familiar tone with Karamanlis’s energy strategy.
[2015-06-26 13:29:43] <Emmy B> So interesting 🙂 Thnk you WL 🙂

[2015-06-28 11:26:45] <noll> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/paulmasonnews/status/615220840897101824 yet to see msm article mentioning GR instability/ possibility of fear driven coup:
[2015-06-28 11:34:52] <noll> https://medium.com/@paulmasonnews/greece-did-the-just-euro-die-at-4pm-e4ac4fdc37ca
[2015-06-28 11:39:42] <Emmy B> 176 votes pro referendum include the Golden Dawn MPs voting with the Syriza / ANEL gov. Who’s gonna do the coup? Samaras New Democracy is
[2015-06-28 11:41:00] <Emmy B> going to be the big loser I think. Already Castas Karamanlis (embolden by the wiretapping result publicity?) is poking his head and
[2015-06-28 11:42:53] <Emmy B> making public statements after 6 years of silence. The Greek President Pavlopoulos is briefing Karamanlis first then Samaras.
[2015-06-28 11:44:48] <Emmy B> But everything is very difficult and will remain so for a while.
[2015-06-28 11:47:33] <Emmy B> There are deeply entrenched interests financial, political patronage and security links with NATO with the US & allies, the constraints
[2015-06-28 11:48:40] <Emmy B> are many. As long as gov remains uncorrupt whatever steps they take will be for the best.
[2015-06-28 11:49:46] <Emmy B> Parliament president recently visited the parliamentary vaults and got photographed in the place where ‘the Files of Cyprus’ are held
[2015-06-28 11:50:19] <LibertarianLibrarian> I wish the new Greek govt all the best. Looks like they’re facing some of the issues Correa is in Ecuador only worse b/c of NATO & EU.
[2015-06-28 11:50:44] <Emmy B> documents that remain secret for 40 years since the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus
[2015-06-28 11:51:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> I just wish I could get a govt that isn’t buried in corruption. Other than a few standouts… *sigh*
[2015-06-28 11:52:46] <LibertarianLibrarian> Maybe those will get released to history some time, Emmy.
[2015-06-28 11:53:33] <Emmy B> This visit was a message and photo opportunity was a political message.
[2015-06-28 11:53:47] <Emmy B> I hope so too Jenny <3
[2015-06-28 11:55:32] <LibertarianLibrarian> We need more protected, unredactable, undeletable archived like WL is creating. As bad as some of it makes my country’s govt look
[2015-06-28 11:56:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> deservedly so, I’m glad for PLUSD and the others. Historically, culturally, ethically, politically invaluable.
[2015-06-28 11:57:14] <Emmy B> I agree! 🙂
[2015-06-28 11:58:12] <LibertarianLibrarian> Anyway, congrats on Greece’s growing independence – loved seeing the call for a national referendum and the effect. 🙂
[2015-06-28 12:01:11] <LibertarianLibrarian> It’s a tough balance internal to any country and internationally, balancing growing worldwide connectivity with national sovereignity
[2015-06-28 12:02:32] <LibertarianLibrarian> And encouraging multiple cultures, religions, beliefs inside a locality while maintaining civil liberties and balance simultaneously.
[2015-06-28 12:05:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> Integrate with equality before the law for all yet encouraging diversity and allowing individual beliefs, even when they disgust you.
[2015-06-28 12:06:25] <LibertarianLibrarian> Wonder if we’ll ever get it right?

[2015-06-28 12:12:20] <Emmy B> Defence Minister Kammenos just offered US another NATO base in Carpathos who is going to sponsor a coup? Gov retains intact mil co-operation
[2015-06-28 12:13:07] <Emmy B> with Israel.
[2015-06-28 12:14:46] <LibertarianLibrarian> Gah, wish they’d toss out the US bases. We don’t need to be sending more troops & spending the $ we need to pay debt & fix problems at home.
[2015-06-28 12:16:33] <LibertarianLibrarian> When I think of conditions in places like Detroit, I get so angry we’re spending billions to put soldiers where not needed or worse.
[2015-06-28 12:16:57] <Emmy B> agree Jenny!
[2015-06-28 12:18:32] <LibertarianLibrarian> Bet cost of 1 base would pay for so much good at home. ARGH! The whole world is insane it seems.
[2015-06-28 12:18:57] <Emmy B> very true
[2015-06-28 12:19:45] <noll> mil-mil relations w/ US are good, but follow the money, or lack of: http://www.state.gov/t/pm/ppa/sat/c14562.htm
[2015-06-28 12:20:28] <LibertarianLibrarian> Like the counts of all the £s spent detaining Julian instead of helping UK citizens.
[2015-06-28 12:20:45] <noll> – traditional ‘restabilizing’ coup. obviously, only in event of huge unrest.
[2015-06-28 12:21:30] <noll> *plenty
[2015-06-28 12:25:44] <LibertarianLibrarian> Craziness! Hate to even think what some of those funds pay for, esp. In places like El Salvador.
[2015-06-28 12:30:44] <Emmy B> I am not going speculate further re Greece a week is a week, we will see how the vote goes, printers will be busy.
[2015-06-28 12:32:24] <Emmy B> but I found the Saudi cable interesting https://wikileaks.org/saudi-cables/doc72106.html
[2015-06-28 12:34:25] <LibertarianLibrarian> I am not sure I want to know who they gave it to – well, I do, but in a ‘watching a postmortem’ kind of way, you know it’ll be bad but need
[2015-06-28 12:34:35] <LibertarianLibrarian> to know
[2015-06-28 12:35:02] <LibertarianLibrarian> In faint hope one could stop it from happening again.
[2015-06-28 12:36:58] <LibertarianLibrarian> OK, I’m taking a mid afternoon nap. Back to work tomorrow and I’m still sore and bruised. Night y’all.

[2015-07-02 22:55:44] <Emmy B> On a Greek note: living abroad is difficult to get the pulse of the country but capital controls have spread fear to all.
[2015-07-02 22:58:51] <Emmy B> fear not only financial. The ‘yes’ campaign misdirects to ‘yes to Europe” rather than ‘yes to austerity’
[2015-07-02 23:00:56] <Emmy B> prompting all kinds of established interests to echo ‘yes to Europe’ – 16 top ranking generals issued open letter ‘Greece belongs to Europe’
[2015-07-02 23:02:54] <Emmy B> The political tremors reveal the insecurity of the country regarding its sovereignty. Statements by Tsipras yesterday at Ministry of Defence
[2015-07-02 23:05:47] <Emmy B> visit that the country’s geopolitical direction remains the same (ie we stay in NATO/EU) would not have been necessary if not heavyweights
[2015-07-02 23:09:04] <Emmy B> did not apply pressure that Tsipras’ gov emancipating referendum rocking the boat of status quo is a dangerous sign of independent politics.
[2015-07-02 23:11:47] <Emmy B> Dangerous not so much because it offers the people a say directly, challenging the elitist aspect of representative democracy (although
[2015-07-02 23:13:14] <Emmy B> there is an aspect of this too) but also dangerous because of what US might do (UK previously) echoing Greece/Cyprus past of being very
[2015-07-02 23:14:11] <Emmy B> much a foreign protectorate (Cyprus pervertedly still is).
[2015-07-02 23:16:07] <Emmy B> Awaiting the referendum results with interest. Syriza got 36% in January. What will the ppl vote? will fear prevail?
[2015-07-03 00:34:38] <Emmy B> Every single party, ex PM of last 30 years campaigns ‘yes’ to austerity as ‘yes’ to Europe. Private Media all en mass pro yes.

[2015-07-05 08:11:02] <WISE Up Action> Any1 welcome to use,H, w/o need for credit;it’s better English & may convey sense better, but I think it might be a good idea to run it past
[2015-07-05 08:11:49] <WISE Up Action> someone else I know for accuracy first.
[2015-07-05 10:39:24] <Emmy B> Greferendum is over what a relief, no dead or injured, no ‘troubles’ I can smile and smile, could it be such history is in the past?
[2015-07-05 10:39:39] <Emmy B> at least for now 🙂
[2015-07-05 10:43:39] <Emmy B> In January election Syriza won the election today they seemed to win the right to govern.
[2015-07-05 10:44:34] <Emmy B> unbelievable results projected a ‘No’ vote at 60 % let’s see it to the end though
[2015-07-05 11:13:28] <noll> hi Action, it seems fine. we’ll link back as soon as finished w/ MGT.
[2015-07-05 11:21:31] <WISE Up Action> Just getting it checked by french speaker now, H. And still noticing silly single word errors myself! Do what you want but will let you know

[2015-07-05 13:21:48] <LibertarianLibrarian> Wow, Emmy, that would be really decisive. Hope your family is well during all this.

[2015-07-05 13:41:23] <Emmy B> @ Jenny Thank you ! all is well. @ hazel yes resignation very timely, Bakogianni (Mitsotakis’s daughter demanded it publically) her dad a
[2015-07-05 13:42:47] <Emmy B> party heavyweight, both of his children high in the party, Bakogianni has served as foreign minister (see cablegate), his son an MP.
[2015-07-05 13:42:52] <Emmy B> *yes this is Greece*
[2015-07-05 13:43:54] <Emmy B> Her first husband was assassinated by 17th of November. She is very well respected in the party although never favoured with leadership.
[2015-07-05 13:45:13] <Emmy B> Current husband was mentioned having undeclared $ abroad. The Mitsotaki family are from Crete, pro US. Father was PM for many years.
[2015-07-05 13:48:29] <Emmy B> It is not clear to me who may take Samaras place.
[2015-07-05 13:49:47] <Emmy B> Internal changes in New Democracy party may cause the gov some heartache as Anel MPs still close to ND (their party of origin) and with
[2015-07-05 13:50:27] <Emmy B> changes at mothership they may wish to jump their current ship, to bring the coalition down. All senarios, one thing is for sure the road is
[2015-07-05 13:50:38] <Emmy B> bumpy.
[2015-07-05 13:51:33] <Emmy B> @ WL thank you so much for all you have done, I hope the troika plans exposed bring some more hope to many <3
[2015-07-05 13:54:43] <LibertarianLibrarian> Wishing for the best, Emmy. Looks like the Greek people have support from many people worldwide.
[2015-07-05 14:15:27] <Emmy B> It is very moving and very unbelievable.
[2015-07-05 14:52:10] <WISE Up Action> It IS very moving, Em. Congrats. So encouraging to see people actually rejecting MSM brainwashing. I bet you’re in shock! xx

[2015-07-06 07:28:41] <LibertarianLibrarian> I know Barret’s case, just… this was all over Twitter, reaching thousands of people already, so it didn’t occur to me at this time.
[2015-07-06 07:31:29] <LibertarianLibrarian> I wonder how many people it did reach, take ioerror’s thousands, my thousand, other RT’s followers and so on.
[2015-07-06 07:36:50] <noll> have no idea how Brown case effects things, some journalists are linking, some are not, & perhaps waiting for it to be covered by 1st Amen

[2015-07-06 07:41:48] <LibertarianLibrarian> I wouldn’t trust the source. Regardless, the stable doors are wide open and the horses out, to use an old cliché.
[2015-07-06 07:44:19] <LibertarianLibrarian> They were forced to drop it in Barret’s case and that wasn’t Twitter which spreads like wildfire.

[2015-07-06 08:16:58] <LibertarianLibrarian> Barrett’s real issues were his angry reaction to the FBI abusing his mother – he publicly threatened an FBI agent. That’s why he’s in jail.
[2015-07-06 08:18:04] <LibertarianLibrarian> I don’t blame him much, if it was my Mom I’d react badly too, but he went just a bit overboard. Still, I think the FBI is truly at fault.
[2015-07-06 08:18:57] <LibertarianLibrarian> They are allowed too much leeway to abuse people during investigations, same problem we have with local police.
[2015-07-06 08:19:29] <LibertarianLibrarian> This country desperately needs enforced accountability for law enforcment.
[2015-07-06 08:19:42] <LibertarianLibrarian> But that’s another soapbox.
[2015-07-06 08:33:42] <LibertarianLibrarian> I’ve seen people posting mirror sites for the material already. In this case, they can’t focus on an individual, it’s internationally spread

[2015-07-06 11:05:26] <Emmy B> Although when I read it many years back I could not but note the obvious discriminatory attitudes of the three British Agents, very telling
[2015-07-06 11:05:48] <Emmy B> of British attitudes and agenda at the time.
[2015-07-06 11:12:41] <Emmy B> US involvement in Greece was from at least 1943 with the deployment of OSS http://www.ossog.org/greek.html
[2015-07-06 11:14:16] <Emmy B> Who recruited locally in Greece members from minor resistance groups (like PAO) for their operations of Monarchical political orientation.
[2015-07-06 11:16:56] <Emmy B> So by the end of the war both British and US had developed a foothold among minority armed groups under their control (and pay) which later
[2015-07-06 11:17:38] <Emmy B> continued their action during the civil war on the side of the British and US for the re-establishment of Monarchy in Greece.
[2015-07-06 11:18:15] <Emmy B> I will take resource to Greece with me for reading 🙂
[2015-07-06 11:37:57] <noll> Em, not sure if you saw this tweet, looks like Greece was also one of first instances of USAID style ‘aid’. https://twitter.com/hazelpress/status/618114489951645696
[2015-07-06 11:48:51] <Emmy B> We gave up 600 books in 2006 to our local library to counter balance my ‘must have it, must hoard it’ attitude – I don’t buy books any more.

[2015-07-10 06:48:12] <LibertarianLibrarian> I agree. Glad to see people in France speaking up for JA.
[2015-07-10 06:50:55] <WISE Up Action> Dunno,H. What nationality is Greta voidiss? I thought to do the letter really because of some familiarity with the style and context.

[2015-07-10 06:55:35] <noll> Action, we don’t know Greta’s nationality, & don’t know any French speakers. those letters are short, be great to add them to J letter page.

[2015-07-12 06:00:39] <Emmy B> nothing
[2015-07-12 06:22:16] <Emmy B> My opinion is that only legal paths are likely to bring about any result but we have seen through Cabledrummmer’s and Chris’s action that
[2015-07-12 06:23:20] <Emmy B> this is time consuming, financially costly, emotionally draining, takes a very long time and not everyone is prepared to go down that path.
[2015-07-12 06:25:17] <Emmy B> We continue to a. support those with legal cases with gathering evidence. b. document what is happening. c. Inform community.

[2015-07-12 07:01:31] <Emmy B> The then Greek PM Kostas Simitis was of ‘the German fraction’ of PASOK with deep links with Germany, see his brother Spyros Simitis

[2015-07-12 07:24:46] <Emmy B> it is grand theatre indeed but the terms of austerity are very real. The damage is already done in that the ‘European dream’ has evaporated
[2015-07-12 07:25:04] <Emmy B> but maybe this is a good thing.
[2015-07-12 07:26:24] <Emmy B> also implications for plans for a European Army must be affected now…the EU current stand is telling on how it may react at a possible
[2015-07-12 07:27:26] <Emmy B> crisis with Turkey in the Aegean, only a fool now would believe the alliance has benefits re national security.
[2015-07-12 07:29:06] <Emmy B> As time goes all this will sink in to the people’s psychy
[2015-07-12 07:32:12] <Emmy B> Interesting also to see Russia’s stance… to all those who accused Tsipras speaking to Putin as changing geopolitically rather than
[2015-07-12 07:33:27] <Emmy B> just enacting diplomacy…Russia’s complete silence and inactivity proves it has no ambition in this matter other than to score some points

[2015-07-12 10:57:19] <Emmy B> Does anyone know? have a plan? because it seems rather chaotic with so many countries involved
[2015-07-12 10:59:22] <Emmy B> The referendum did clarify many things. For example that political establishment and media lied and colluded and lied some more & but lost
[2015-07-12 11:00:49] <Emmy B> Samaras resigned, but why? after Syriza, New Democracy is the second strongest party, why did its leader resign, he faced no rebellion.
[2015-07-12 11:02:49] <Emmy B> It seems someone whistled and he resigned, no one is asking any questions. They have gone quiet. The temporary leader is very divisive

[2015-07-12 11:04:27] <Emmy B> neither does the party has set process for the selection of new leader.
[2015-07-12 11:05:51] <noll> “Do we really know what is at play here?” not really.. “anyone who is confident about anything here is deluding himself.”
[2015-07-12 11:07:26] <Emmy B> It is all about interests but what are these interest? They must be financial but difficult to really see them. When the political landscape
[2015-07-12 11:08:46] <Emmy B> Europe has become so monotonous, when political ideology has been declared dead in a post modern world and efficiency was the new mantra
[2015-07-12 11:10:19] <Emmy B> e.g. hardly any difference btw Labour/Tories, Pasok/New Democracy… then we look at a barren political landscape.
[2015-07-12 11:11:31] <Emmy B> Even Syriza, with a clear ideological difference, struggles to articulate or bring about a plan outside the established rules of the game
[2015-07-12 11:12:58] <noll> one thing clear re interests – Germany again willing to use force, & its choices follow the old pattern – think SNP’s rose garden just died.
[2015-07-12 11:13:26] <Emmy B> Whatever interests these are, are so institutionalised one might have to live on a different planet to dare to think,
[2015-07-12 11:13:32] <Emmy B> and unable to function in the ‘real world’
[2015-07-12 11:15:07] <Emmy B> Well re Scotland SNP already knows what it means to be conquered and dominated. It already knows that ‘Union’ is a beautification of
[2015-07-12 11:15:23] <Emmy B> what England imposed by force.
[2015-07-12 11:16:12] <Emmy B> We shall see what lessons we all learn from all this.
[2015-07-12 11:18:09] <Emmy B> In the meanwhile, Greece expends all its politics on this matter and the country needs to be governed. Extremely important particularly
[2015-07-12 11:18:18] <Emmy B> in times of crisis.
[2015-07-12 11:18:50] <noll> Syriza made classic mistake of left re German right.
[2015-07-12 11:19:49] <Emmy B> The crisis is dismantling the state due to resource starvation, and is also dismantling the state with political energy trapped in a mire.

[2015-07-12 12:35:42] <Emmy B> treated. Once more narrowly technocratic rather than political ie, a federation of states (not strictly speaking but still this is
[2015-07-12 12:36:04] <Emmy B> how Eurogroup attempts to behave as) if not ruled by such narrow motivations?
[2015-07-12 12:36:27] <noll> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/traynorbrussels/status/620295106092883968 Indeed.
[2015-07-12 12:36:36] <Emmy B> why do they want a common currency for a common market unless they act as such.
[2015-07-12 12:39:03] <Emmy B> imagine Essex going bankrupt within the UK. It would be madness to kick them out of the pound area. The wealthy city on the other hand
[2015-07-12 12:40:24] <Emmy B> despite is semi autonomy is forced to share its wealth tax wise with other pound regions within UK. Euro does not have ways of easing out
[2015-07-12 12:43:21] <Emmy B> structural imbalances that create surpluses/deficits.
[2015-07-12 12:51:18] <Emmy B> *on a humorous point* instead of locking 50 billion worth of Greek assets in Lux as collateral why not demand Lux disclose Greek Tax evaders
[2015-07-12 12:53:06] <Emmy B> and seize their assets? from which Lux benefits, one has to wonder the sanity of the brain that imagined the German plan.

[2015-07-13 01:54:57] <Emmy B> The loss of sovereignty in a country with existential threats (and Greek compliance) sends the worst possible message to those whose who
[2015-07-13 01:57:25] <Emmy B> threaten its very existence. The Oxi in the referendum had more value than billions spent in armaments as a deterrent. Present capitulation

[2015-07-13 11:07:40] <Emmy B> In this meeting on the 6th of July all political leaders under the moderating role of the Greek President of the democracy agreed a proposal
[2015-07-13 11:08:56] <Emmy B> to put forward to Eurogroup. Today, Panos Kamenos (leader of the minority party ANEL in coalition) says, that proposal had ben brokered with
[2015-07-13 11:10:04] <Emmy B> the mediation of France, who re-assured them that it would have been accepted at Eurogroup. On that basis the gov took it to parliament &
[2015-07-13 11:10:20] <Emmy B> it was ratified by 251/300 MPs
[2015-07-13 11:11:08] <Emmy B> But when gov went to Eurogroup the proposal was immediately dismissed.
[2015-07-13 11:11:38] <Emmy B> He also talks about ‘coup’ it might be he will leave coalition
[2015-07-13 11:13:11] <Emmy B> He says Tsipras was blackmailed with the total collapse of the banks and the complete haircut of Greek deposits.

[2015-07-14 03:32:31] <Emmy B> Russian EU sanctions means Greece has lost 70% of its export market for Agriculture.

[2015-07-15 04:54:04] <Emmy B> Re AA – great PR in advance of further statements by her re her case reaching statutory limit. I suppose from then onwards we could expect
[2015-07-15 04:56:01] <Emmy B> monetisation in form of books, articles etc? Which British Tabloid will get the ‘kiss and tell’ story and for how much? Ridiculous!

[2015-07-15 05:21:24] <Emmy B> honestly, thank goodness, he hasn’t resigned and the facts he quotes go onto Parliamentary record. #ThisIsaCoup
[2015-07-15 05:24:43] <noll> re AA, but what will play better in terms of greater role in politics? & re tweets, somewhat sim’ to Louise Mensch..
[2015-07-15 05:40:15] <noll> Robert Fisk – always well worth reading re anything Mid East http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/iran-nuclear-deal-however-the-great-and-good-represent-it-america-has-now-taken-the-shia-side-in-the-middle-easts-sectarian-war-10388940.html
[2015-07-15 05:52:16] <noll> – Fisk misses out Kerry’s biggest 18 day motive – spectre of Saudi/ Iran & then regional nuclear arms race.
[2015-07-15 06:08:11] <LibertarianLibrarian> I’m glad that we’ve got you, Emmy, on the Greek situation. I’m learning so much about European politics. Sad to say it seems as bad as US.
[2015-07-15 06:11:08] <LibertarianLibrarian> Re AA… acting like Louise Mensch is a terrible choice. I haven’t translated the Swedish yet, what has she attacked him on? I somehow doubt
[2015-07-15 06:11:46] <LibertarianLibrarian> it’s just literary criticism. If it’s racial, religious, or political, that’s just plain foolish.
[2015-07-15 06:13:33] <LibertarianLibrarian> And considering that she fabricated evidence and clearly lied, she’d even more stupid to try to get more publicity or money. I still suspect
[2015-07-15 06:15:48] <LibertarianLibrarian> she’s an attention-seeker.
[2015-07-15 06:34:17] <LibertarianLibrarian> Oh, that is awful. So painful for the family.

[2015-07-23 11:21:02] <M> Guardian: “sexual molestation & rape charges”. Though it is Esther Addley iirc creator of “anti-privacy” title for WL http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/23/julian-assange-ecuador-and-sweden-in-tense-standoff-over-interview
[2015-07-23 11:25:55] <M> Correct in article body, though. And there’s a lot of interesting information.
[2015-07-23 11:27:54] <M> Sweden says it will interpret Ecuador’s requested protocols (i.e. presence of diplomatic staff) as a refusal to grant access to Assange.
[2015-07-23 11:28:31] <M> Also JA may be allowed further appeal through Swedish courts if the failure to question continues.
[2015-07-23 11:30:19] <M> Sweden says it will interpret Ecuador’s request for pre-interview agreement between Ecuador/Sweden as a refusal to grant access to Assange.
[2015-07-23 11:30:21] <M> Also JA may be allowed further appeal through Swedish courts if the failure to question continues.
[2015-07-23 11:43:36] <LibertarianLibrarian> Wow, Ny’s seeking any possible excuse, however absurd, to avoid the interview. Wonder if her failure will bring up possibility of SC revisit
[2015-07-23 11:44:39] <LibertarianLibrarian> How can a request for pre-interview agreement be grounds for refusal?
[2015-07-23 11:45:15] <LibertarianLibrarian> Do these people even think about how ridiculous this makes them look?
[2015-07-23 11:46:02] <LibertarianLibrarian> But it wouldn’t be bad for PES & TO to get back into court; maybe finally force release of evidence.
[2015-07-23 11:46:33] <LibertarianLibrarian> But wow, how is Ny not fired by now?
[2015-07-23 12:43:38] <noll> https://twitter.com/hazelpress/status/624303808299012096
[2015-07-23 12:45:32] <noll> UK guidelines show Ny seems to have things backwards – as always – the question is not who can attend from host state, but can she.
[2015-07-23 13:06:28] <LibertarianLibrarian> That’s just arrogance, she doesn’t like having to get permission even from a sovereign nation or be seen doing so.
[2015-07-23 13:08:55] <WISE Up Action> More ‘prestige’ issues?
[2015-07-23 13:29:57] <noll> jtlyk our HO FOI re DNA requests has been denied, we’re now sending it to National Crime Agency.
[2015-07-23 13:32:08] <noll> no reply yet re ‘EAW and detainment without charge’ question, & as mentioned HO has requested more time to answer FOI re JA assassination.

[2015-07-24 20:07:42] <noll> if you want to know just how pathetic UK FIO is, just look at Cheney lounging & yawning his way through 9/11: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3174018/Never-seen-pictures-inside-White-House-9-11-Bush-Cheney-immediate-aftermath-Twin-Towers-terror-attack.html

[2015-07-25 00:17:43] <Emmy B> Thank you for sharing M this is good!
[2015-07-25 00:18:43] <Emmy B> [Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/624841192673570819/624841192694542336/06KuWAVb.png
[2015-07-25 00:20:00] <Emmy B> In the AFP article shared by WL about Turkey striking PKK and ISIS at the same time, there is the concluding sentence above.
[2015-07-25 00:22:01] <Emmy B> Greek National security blog On Alert reported yesterday that US F16 were stopping on Crete on their way to Icirlik. I am not an expert but
[2015-07-25 00:23:13] <Emmy B> this is curious as there is no distance at all between Crete and Incirilik, why would they need to stop off at Crete for e.g. refuelling.
[2015-07-25 00:24:33] <Emmy B> Also be aware the current UN supervised ‘negotiations’ between Turkish and Greek Cypriots to legalise the 1974 Turkish invasion by de facto
[2015-07-25 00:27:23] <Emmy B> recognition of bi community bi zonal ‘solution’.
[2015-07-25 00:28:52] <Emmy B> US has not only accepted tacitly the bombing of Northern Iraq positions it would have also strengthened Turkey’s hand in Cyprus.
[2015-07-25 00:31:53] <WISE Up Action> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/AJENews/status/624810062750576640
[2015-07-25 00:35:04] <Emmy B> Again although not an expert I should mention that Ege Ordusu, the 4th Turkish Aegean Regiment (military base in Ismir) created in 1975 is
[2015-07-25 00:35:52] <Emmy B> responsible for the 40,000 Turkish troops occupying 40% of Cyprus.
[2015-07-25 00:37:53] <Emmy B> it also has a mandate to ‘protect Turkish West Coast from Greek aggression). Reminding that Turkish Parliament has declared ‘Casus Belli’
[2015-07-25 00:39:19] <Emmy B> if Greece extends it’s island’s naval territorial control from 6 miles to 12 miles which would have been its right as per international law
[2015-07-25 00:43:29] <Emmy B> Also note that Icirlik is the location from which http://famagusta-gazette.com/breaking-british-typhoons-in-near-clash-with-turkish-jets-over-cyprus-p20439-69.htm
[2015-07-25 00:44:23] <Emmy B> considering recent operational failures by British RAF in Cyprus: http://www.euronews.com/2015/07/15/british-warplane-accidentally-drops-missiles-onto-its-base/
[2015-07-25 00:46:09] <Emmy B> due to being overstretched, as well as political constraints faced by Cameron’s gov in going further into the dark with the US in Syria/Iraq
[2015-07-25 00:48:49] <Emmy B> The upgrade of Incirlik will mean potentially a stronger Turkey in the regional game of power, going further than UK could ever go.
[2015-07-25 00:51:52] <Emmy B> Greece still refuses US drones being placed in Crete but for how long I wonder. Turkey has accepted them. Keep all this in mind when reading
[2015-07-25 00:54:56] <Emmy B> about political developments in Greece. The country is ruined economically but see how the proponents of 2.4% of budget allocated to defence
[2015-07-25 00:55:09] <Emmy B> will always win, no matter what.
[2015-07-25 01:53:51] <Emmy B> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/greekemmy/status/624864968433901568
[2015-07-25 05:39:00] <noll> fyi this is Ecuador’s ‘Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters’ policy: http://www.cancilleria.gob.ec/international-criminal-assistance/
[2015-07-25 05:57:06] <noll> – fact that Ecu does not have MLA w/ Sweden is almost meaningless, b/c difference b/w Ecu policy & Swe/ EU is nonexistent. it should take
[2015-07-25 05:58:56] <noll> an afternoon to make the arrangements, yet Ny is taking 15 days to make one translation. why?
[2015-07-25 06:02:01] <noll> as mentioned in several articles – one issue exists – that Ny will again have to misrepresent evidence: https://archive.is/hSj2X#selection-631.0-631.161
[2015-07-25 06:03:43] <noll> context (unlike the EAW situ) lying & distorting will leave Ny open to all sorts of legal action. a countdown will begin on her end.
[2015-07-25 06:29:33] <LibertarianLibrarian> That may well be the reason for her endless stalling. If she has to produce real evidence, she has to know her ‘case’ collapses.
[2015-07-25 07:43:24] <noll> – according to Swedish guidelines, Ny has to follow Ecu procedures – which as seen follow international norms: https://archive.is/FlKRa#selection-847.0-847.92
[2015-07-25 08:05:21] <noll> ie. https://archive.is/FlKRa#selection-865.0-865.167

[2015-07-25 09:25:28] <Emmy B> All good information, Thank you H!
[2015-07-25 10:34:45] <WikiLeaks> It would be helpful if people filed a great many Swedish foia’s to various swedish ministries in relation to the case handling.
[2015-07-25 10:36:00] <WikiLeaks> And do so in such a way where these ministries then have to consult with Ny’s office as to redactions, creating a paper trail.
[2015-07-25 10:36:56] <WikiLeaks> For instance, we hear that Ny has a record of a number of prosecutorial abuses and destruction of evidence.
[2015-07-25 10:38:23] <WikiLeaks> We don’t want to be presecriptive or there may be duplication.
[2015-07-25 10:39:35] <WikiLeaks> We are also worried that come the statue of limitations, Ny and the MoJ will be able to destroy material.
[2015-07-25 10:47:21] <LibertarianLibrarian> That’s a great idea! Would it have to be Swedish citizens or journalists? I’m sure @ProfessorsBlogg would be willing to help.
[2015-07-25 10:48:04] <WikiLeaks> Doesn’t have to be Swedish.
[2015-07-25 10:48:33] <WikiLeaks> Or journalists.
[2015-07-25 10:48:53] <LibertarianLibrarian> If non-Swedish, non-Journalists can send these, if someone writes them up in Swedish & gives me the addresses, I’d be willing to mail them.
[2015-07-25 10:49:49] <noll> Wls, we will file that FOI & research other FOI possibilities. we intend to create a dedicated FOI page when the next HO FOI comes in.
[2015-07-25 10:50:51] <LibertarianLibrarian> Sounds good Hazel. If we set some standard text and a list of addresses, several of us can send them. Greta will, if I ask.
[2015-07-25 10:51:45] <WikiLeaks> You just need to mention ‘offentlighetsprincipen’. You can write in english.
[2015-07-25 10:52:22] <noll> https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offentlighetsprincipen
[2015-07-25 10:57:52] <noll> Jen, Wls stated “if people filed great many Swe foia” – suggest ppl create FOIs independently & not standardized to avoid duplication.
[2015-07-25 10:58:50] <WikiLeaks> Yes. People should pick their own, obscure angles.
[2015-07-25 11:00:21] <WikiLeaks> (well, not necessary obscure, but an idea that others are less likely to have)
[2015-07-25 11:01:35] <WikiLeaks> You can also ask for answers, not just for documents, i.e why was something done, or statistics.
[2015-07-25 11:01:37] <LibertarianLibrarian> OK, I’ll look at some of Hazel’s & others to get a sense of how to write one, then give it a shot. And encourage others to do same.
[2015-07-25 11:01:57] <WikiLeaks> They are required to provide answers unless they can find an excuse that such a calculation would be onerous.
[2015-07-25 12:00:41] <noll> document & information request sent to Göteborg & Stockholm re ‘Ny record’.
[2015-07-25 12:35:32] <WikiLeaks> Information as to the structure of the Swedish government is here: http://www.government.se/government-of-sweden/
[2015-07-25 12:36:58] <WikiLeaks> Swedish FOIA is the one part of Sweden that mostly lives up to the hype although it’s in rapid decay.
[2015-07-25 12:37:26] <WikiLeaks> e.g Bildt moving all his emails off to gmail.
[2015-07-25 12:42:27] <noll> http://www.government.se/contacts/#2079

[2015-07-26 11:01:46] <WikiLeaks> Sweden has arrested Snoop Dogg
[2015-07-26 11:02:03] <WikiLeaks> It’s an important moment to bring attention to the reality of Sweden.
[2015-07-26 12:13:08] <Emmy B> Did quite a lot of tweeting about it. Let us see if the matter will move from entertainment news to politics.
[2015-07-27 04:58:26] <LibertarianLibrarian> That’s interesting, if slightly bizarre. I’ll read up on it. I’ve sketched out two FOI requests, just need to finish & decide where to send.
[2015-07-27 05:00:13] <LibertarianLibrarian> This is one to follow up on. https://twitter.com/rixstep/status/625044479242825728
[2015-07-27 09:11:32] <Emmy B> Well done Jenny! In a couple of days I will settle a bit in my holiday surroundings and then can take a look at what I might be able to do.
[2015-07-27 09:11:44] <Emmy B> keep us informed please xxx
[2015-07-27 10:01:30] <noll> if Swe FOI avoidance methods are different & faster to UK’s, it’s ends are still the same. https://twitter.com/hazelpress/status/625711842661408769https://twitter.com/hazelpress/status/625710277028356097
[2015-07-27 10:52:59] <noll> http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/27/labour-is-now-so-passive-it-might-as-well-be-led-by-an-out-of-office-email
[2015-07-27 11:21:22] <Emmy B> May I leave my imagination completely free and suggest that labour knows that GCHQ & Cameron knows every skeleton in the cupboard &
[2015-07-27 11:22:52] <Emmy B> are simply scared ? see the recent scoops of rightwing press regarding Lord so and so. We might laugh at his predicament and be disgusted at
[2015-07-27 11:23:56] <Emmy B> his hypocrisy but we now know GCHQ would know their secrets going back decades and gov will have access, neither will they be afraid to use
[2015-07-27 11:25:26] <Emmy B> the info to their advantage. Labour is now cut off from access as they are no longer government. Why is it SNP that has risen to be the
[2015-07-27 11:26:48] <Emmy B> opposition? They are new in Westminster and therefore, it might be a while before their GCHQ files all get up to date and through
[2015-07-27 11:26:52] <Emmy B> the bureaucracy
[2015-07-27 11:28:05] <Emmy B> If there was ever a FOI for such matters I would try to map out the leak channels between gov/GCHQ/Media, it might be informal but there
[2015-07-27 11:28:49] <Emmy B> might be electronic in nature and considering that they are currently exempt form FOI, they might be sloppy.
[2015-07-27 11:29:31] <Emmy B> There… 🙂 imagination back in the box 🙂
[2015-07-27 11:31:03] <Emmy B> One more thing… before Snowden, political elit would have some idea about being spied on by GCHQ and the previous equivalent, but now the
[2015-07-27 11:32:41] <Emmy B> extent of the surveillance revealed by Snowden is simply horrifying. Also, now who ever uses the system, knows that evryone knows, sees that
[2015-07-27 11:33:36] <Emmy B> no one acts to stop the spying and is emboldened to use the information in political blackmail more often. Previously, they would always
[2015-07-27 11:35:19] <Emmy B> strive to be moderate so as not to reveal the extent of the spying. Prepare for more scandals I say.
[2015-07-27 11:35:41] <Emmy B> *end of rant* 🙂
[2015-07-27 13:13:48] <Emmy B> But the power of Blackmail is not in exposure but in the threat of exposure, so they throw the expendable out in the most humiliating way
[2015-07-27 13:15:22] <Emmy B> possibly by parallel construction (why on earth would the sex workers entrap him like this? this is very rare) to show the real target of
[2015-07-27 13:16:29] <Emmy B> what they will do to them. But with regards to the article you shared about passivity…it is remarkable the number of MPs who toed the
[2015-07-27 13:16:33] <Emmy B> line and abstained.
[2015-07-27 14:11:42] <WikiLeaks> Sewel punked as a way for Murdoch, cops and someone else to demonstrate their power over legislative positions.
[2015-07-27 14:13:50] <WikiLeaks> It’s unclear whether he offended someone or whether he was just a useful bit of meat to very publicly make a burger from.
[2015-07-27 14:16:31] <WikiLeaks> Either way, the legislative class is smelling the roast and wondering who’s next and taking lessons on who not to offend.
[2015-07-27 14:36:40] <noll> agree. / on a lighter/ less lighter note: https://medium.com/matter/it-s-not-climate-change-it-s-everything-change-8fd9aa671804https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MaddAddam_(TV_series)

[2015-07-28 23:20:10] <Emmy B> off topic, snipets from Greece: my relations left their cherry and black cherry crop rot on the trees, local Merchants unable to trade due
[2015-07-28 23:20:48] <Emmy B> to capital controls imposed a week before referendum.
[2015-07-28 23:23:00] <Emmy B> they were not the only one’s to do so, farming production very much relies on local merchants providing contracts upon which hands are hired
[2015-07-28 23:24:32] <Emmy B> to collect crops, store it till merchants takes it over. Without contracts harvesting simply stalled & as goods r perishable, was abandoned.
[2015-07-28 23:26:32] <Emmy B> Shocking waste! that’s how food prices shoot up, when markets fail. Capital controls have had tremendous damaging effect in real economy.
[2015-07-28 23:27:32] <Emmy B> there are simply no alternative systems for immediate replacement of the established systems of transactions and trade fails spectacularly.
[2015-07-28 23:29:05] <Emmy B> Luckily, Greek farming is not commodity based but if such failures like the one I described happen across crops, what was a predominantly
[2015-07-28 23:30:49] <Emmy B> urban financial crisis will now be spreading deeply into the country-side. Feeding back into the cities with high prices. Unbelievable!.

[2015-08-05 14:20:12] <Emmy B> He should have uploaded to WL instead of 4chan: http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/a-junior-defence-staffer-allegedly-took-home-an-intelligence-report-and-posted-it-online-20150804-gir4rq.html

[2015-08-06 02:05:13] <Emmy B> He si very keen to support and says will issue DVD in Sep with the show, linking to WikiLeaks/donate page.
[2015-08-06 02:06:32] <Emmy B> Thanking Somerset Bean for the flyer design – as always 🙂
[2015-08-06 03:46:44] <Bean> A pleasure – thx. Have a couple of social media images ready for the 16th—will set them up as print ready files over next few days & send 🙂
[2015-08-06 03:49:05] <Emmy B> Thank you vm, the sooner the better pls as I will ask printer to print and dispatch to vigil ppl as I am in Greece, I cannot do it myself x
[2015-08-06 03:52:44] <Bean> right-o 🙂
[2015-08-06 10:16:05] <WISE Up Action> Hi all, short post re vigil on the 16th. http://wiseupaction.info/2015/08/06/call-out-16-august-support-julian-assange-and-ecuador-on-3rd-anniversary-of-granting-of-asylum/
[2015-08-06 10:32:42] <Emmy B> Excellent! Thank you very much Dave x I have enlarged the images and replace one (of the charges) with another. Please tweet and we take it
[2015-08-06 10:33:56] <Emmy B> from there 🙂 Many ppl are on holidays (like myself) and we don’t give the remainder much notice but there will be a presence to mark event
[2015-08-06 10:34:11] <Emmy B> Thank you again for stepping up xxx 🙂
[2015-08-06 10:59:32] <M> Interesting transcript of Ny press conference after court ruling. Ny cites “complexity of process” as reason for not questioning in UK.

[2015-08-06 11:01:32] <M> Ny also says she has no knowledge of a US investigation taking place. Most of it is just avoidance/non-answers.
[2015-08-06 14:43:09] <LibertarianLibrarian> Avoidance seems to be her strategy from day one. It’s clear that this was a political play not a legal one. Her job has been to stall.

[2015-08-06 23:28:40] <Emmy B> They are determined not to question him under any circumstances which is their consistent strategy from the very beginning.

[2015-08-08 23:45:13] <Emmy B> Yes thank you Bean <3 I can’t open all files for some reason but maybe it is my end. I will get in touch with printer Monday, all sent in
[2015-08-08 23:46:25] <Emmy B> good time and excellent work as usual. Loving your work!

[2015-08-10 06:53:20] <Emmy B> Congratulations HP, finally FOI work with good facts quoted by Associated Press 🙂

[2015-08-10 07:11:19] <WISE Up Action> Congrats and thanks HP. Great work. Truth uncorked.
[2015-08-10 07:32:55] <Emmy B> Question: Is The Guardian keeping silent on the Press Association release? The Independent only paper that has re-produced it so far I think
[2015-08-10 07:34:24] <M> Maybe ask @davidgcrouch if he’s planning on writing about it.
[2015-08-10 07:35:28] <Emmy B> Good idea!
[2015-08-10 08:03:13] <WikiLeaks> What’s the independnt link?
[2015-08-10 08:04:39] <noll> http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/swedish-prosecutors-accused-of-victimising-julian-assange-31439906.html
[2015-08-10 08:14:39] <noll> thanks Em, it’s the only FOI received a no-nonsense reply to.
[2015-08-10 08:15:19] <M> It’s in quite a few news sites. Australian, http://News.com.au
[2015-08-10 08:16:33] <LibertarianLibrarian> Glad to see this picked up and shared. Congrats on the recognition of your FOI, Hazel.
[2015-08-10 08:16:39] <M> See: https://news.google.com/news/story?cf=all&hl=en&pz=1&ned=us&q=assange&cf=all&ncl=dNzu4zC65CFSpmMCD2p1ROaK3WZhM&scoring=d
[2015-08-10 08:18:56] <LibertarianLibrarian> Awesome! I’m going to tweet at some US press, not that they’ll pay attention.
[2015-08-10 08:37:03] <Emmy B> (only at half capacity due to holiday) thanks for all the links M !!! So Press Association releases work a treat as a means of disseminating
[2015-08-10 08:37:45] <Emmy B> information without relying on the Guardian etc. Wonderful news!
[2015-08-10 08:39:21] <LibertarianLibrarian> Even Reuters somewhat picked it up, with some twist, of course.
[2015-08-10 08:44:19] <M> Reuters article and/or Swedish Justice Dept tries to use “grant” vs “recognize” asylum as synonyms, which is v confusing.
[2015-08-10 08:45:15] <M> The article has Ecuador saying “we didn’t request that Sweden grant JA asylum.”
[2015-08-10 08:45:43] <M> And Sweden responding: “That’s how we interpreted it – that we have to recognize his asylum.” ???
[2015-08-10 08:50:29] <Emmy B> *sigh* a very cheap ‘lost in translation’ purposefully talking across purposes in an attempt to navigate public op. through muddled water
[2015-08-10 08:50:47] <Emmy B> somehow on ‘their’ side?
[2015-08-10 08:51:50] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, there’s a big different between ‘requesting you do something’ and ‘requesting you recognize what we already did’.
[2015-08-10 08:52:29] <noll> think that’s nonsensical – look at this. also, isn’t “specific case” offer breaching Personal Data Act (1998:204). https://twitter.com/hazelpress/status/630768181204918272
[2015-08-10 08:59:09] <LibertarianLibrarian> You’re emailing FOI requests to Sweden? Oh, I didn’t know you could do that! Much better than snail mail! Which I think disappears.
[2015-08-10 08:59:18] <LibertarianLibrarian> Sometimes.
[2015-08-10 11:09:32] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, the Milgrim experiment certainly teaches us, along with some similar studies, that most humans can be drawn into horrendous behavior.
[2015-08-10 11:10:24] <LibertarianLibrarian> Not that we didn’t already know that. When we studied this in ‘responsible conduct of research” classes, there were other examples too.
[2015-08-10 11:11:43] <LibertarianLibrarian> There was a high school prison one… trying to remember details. I remember photos, though. Some ‘guards’ acted like Nazis. Literally.
[2015-08-10 11:13:11] <LibertarianLibrarian> Beyond Tuskeegee, there’s also one case in a ‘mental hospital’ for children, damn, I’m losing my memory in my old age.
[2015-08-10 11:16:00] <noll> that’s Stanford exp: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment
[2015-08-10 11:19:29] <LibertarianLibrarian> Oh yes, that’s it. We had a guest lecture on this last week. My brain’s dead & I still have 3 student assignments overdue. Grades dropping.
[2015-08-10 11:20:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> Also, I need to refresh my HIPAA and Responsible Conduct of Research certificates soon myself, not just instruct students to do it.
[2015-08-10 11:21:44] <LibertarianLibrarian> Actually the Belmont Report ought to be read and used for more than just clinical research. Those principles are overall good practice.
[2015-08-10 11:28:51] <noll> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Report
[2015-08-10 11:30:35] <noll> w/ Milgrim often viewed w/ re to ppl either in, or assuming positions of power, then causing others to commit immoral acts, but also applies
[2015-08-10 11:36:00] <noll> – to the “victim”, & there’s been s/thing of a taboo in addressing/ examining this aspect of passivity.
[2015-08-10 11:36:02] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, and if they’ve done ANY research involving human subjects, they should’ve been required to read and sign off on the Belmont Report.
[2015-08-10 11:36:39] <LibertarianLibrarian> Those psychologists were in violating of every principle of their discipline not to mention simple human rights and decency.
[2015-08-10 11:36:47] <LibertarianLibrarian> *violation
[2015-08-10 11:38:35] <LibertarianLibrarian> That kind of passivity in response to immoral authority is common, it’s straight-out fear at first, then I think the Stockholm Syndrome –
[2015-08-10 11:39:19] <LibertarianLibrarian> – plays a part as well as the darkness we all struggle with in ourselves. As we know, it takes a special kind of courage to put oneself on –
[2015-08-10 11:39:49] <LibertarianLibrarian> the line and accept the consequences. Or we’d have tons more Mannings & Snowdens.
[2015-08-10 11:40:46] <LibertarianLibrarian> And people don’t want to believe their sons or daughters can get caught up in that kind of behavior, thus the denial of “Collateral Murder”.
[2015-08-10 11:41:36] <LibertarianLibrarian> And what war does to formerly decent people. It violates not just those killed but those doing the killing.
[2015-08-10 12:52:25] <M> AFP report has new quotes from Swedish Justice Dept http://www.9news.com.au/world/2015/08/11/03/29/assange-sex-assault-case-deadlocked
[2015-08-10 14:40:46] <WikiLeaks> Vile.
[2015-08-10 14:47:21] <noll> “Sweden cannot recognise asylum status granted by another country, in line w/ international law” beyond parody. http://www.unhcr.org/3ae68c4447.html
[2015-08-11 06:26:51] <LibertarianLibrarian> That’s insane. How can they say something like that, so obviously erroneous, and expect to look like anything but idiots?
[2015-08-11 06:49:53] <M> David Allen Green writing about JA case again, contacting Swedish Prosecutors. https://archive.is/mwiVP

[2015-08-11 06:50:56] <M> IIRC, Green stated he would never write articles about Assange case again. But apparently his seething animosity is just too overpowered.
[2015-08-11 06:56:33] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/davidallengreen/status/301596155941371904 Ah, apparently he backtracked on it pretty quickly.

[2015-08-12 11:23:12] <noll> most important point – which will not be televised – is that JA has already been q’ed on AA allegations, therefore charges can be brought.

[2015-08-16 12:20:16] <Emmy B> Thank you Somerset Bean! Very grateful for your work as always we’ll be able to use the graphics again and again!
[2015-08-16 12:23:35] <Emmy B> Shameless news about way Chelsea is treated, but her writing has popularised her cause and getting a lot of positive attention before hearing! a timely reminder though on how US treats their dissidents… Political Asylum now more useful than ever.
[2015-08-16 23:25:20] <M> Times has published a hit piece against JA; not sure where the original article is (paywalls, possibly this piece: http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article4529323.ecehttp://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article21260158.ab

[2015-08-17 12:27:20] <Emmy B> Thank you for sharing !
[2015-08-17 15:00:57] <WISE Up Action> Chelsea has filed for a formal court martial to deal w her *infractions* instead of the disciplinary board due tomorrow (at which she wld not be represented)

[2015-08-18 04:33:09] <Emmy B> and Guardian collumnist Gaby Hinsliff sings rom the same hymn song https://www.the-pool.com/news-views/opinion/2015/33/gaby-hinsliff-on-the-julian-assange-situation
[2015-08-18 05:12:10] <WikiLeaks> FYI the Guardian is preparing an attack via its US “feminist” columnist Jessica Valenti
[2015-08-18 05:13:48] <Emmy B> thanks for letting us know!
[2015-08-18 05:14:28] <WikiLeaks> Now only SW is left, Fritz and NY have moved to exploit the situation, with a cyber-harrassment themed counter-attack.
[2015-08-18 05:15:27] <WikiLeaks> SW has given an interview to Valenti as part of the package.
[2015-08-18 05:16:59] <WikiLeaks> SW is on record many times early in the case denying having been raped and accusing the police, so they have an up hill battle
[2015-08-18 05:18:13] <WikiLeaks> painting her as a victim. So they’re going to instead show that she’s a ‘victim’ of trolls and conspiracy theorists, e.g http://sofiawilen.com
[2015-08-18 05:19:24] <WikiLeaks> And posit that this is what happens to all women who are brave enough to report sex crimes.
[2015-08-18 05:20:52] <WikiLeaks> This will resonate with the many women who now work in (social) media, and who due to their public profiles, have been the target of trolls and also legitimate criticism which some reframe as harressment.
[2015-08-18 05:22:38] <Emmy B> Great shame though she has agreed to be used in this PR attack. Let’s see.
[2015-08-18 05:23:22] <WISE Up Action> The Samira Shackle not that bad – at least quotes Carey for a full para. And the other is breakfast trivia, like the Times PoS yesterday – they certainly need to come up with something with a bit more of a hook than if they want to make real waves.
However sounds like what you’re talking about could run and run…
dire
[2015-08-18 05:26:09] <WikiLeaks> Models Valenti is likely looking to exploit are Nicklas Kristof’s “news dressed as opinion” attack on Woody Allen, Gamer Gate, and the recent campus rape debate in US, where she made the following telling claim:
[2015-08-18 05:27:35] <WikiLeaks> “Whether she is able to remain anonymous or not, and even though her story of being raped has not been disproven, the fact that Jackie is not and was not a symbol or a cause, but a person, has been lost in the rush to indict her and anyone who believes her.
I choose to believe Jackie. I lose nothing by doing so, even if I’m later proven wrong—but at least I will still be able to sleep at night for having stood by a young woman who may have been through an awful trauma. “
[2015-08-18 05:30:55] <WikiLeaks> Jackie was subsequently shown to be a fraud, but Valenti was correct to say “I lose nothing by doing so, even if I’m later proven wrong”. This total lack of accountability where there is no risk in siding with the state against the accused but there is risk in siding with the accused against the state, sums up the root cause of the problem.
[2015-08-18 05:33:06] <Emmy B> Thank you for the perspective. Food for thought certainly.
[2015-08-18 05:34:26] <Emmy B> On a practical level, if http://sofiawilen.com
[2015-08-18 05:34:52] <WikiLeaks> In relation to how the state has been framing accused persons, we note the following interesting spectrum of descriptions.
[2015-08-18 05:37:12] <WISE Up Action> Yeh. Can see that. And there’s no shortage of willing recipients for that emotionally fraught territory. Steered correctly it obviously has a serious chance of longevity, being picked up and passed on by others – all with slightly diff angles. Hope the writing is shit.
[2015-08-18 05:38:34] <WikiLeaks> victim, alleged victim, complainant, accuser, plaintif, applicant to imprison, imprisoner, kidnapper
[2015-08-18 05:40:22] <WikiLeaks> media rhetoric strips the applicant to imprison of agency and requisite seriousness on what is proposed
[2015-08-18 05:44:00] <WikiLeaks> The Valenti article may help in the medium term. Although it’s clearly geared to avoid discussing the merits, for obvious reasons, it may lead to a discussion on the merits, and the greater threats against JA’s family which would be very positive.
[2015-08-18 05:46:14] <Emmy B> There is something that stands out ie, if the focus is alleged online harassment of SW one could juxtapose with real life harassment against JA
[2015-08-18 05:46:26] <Emmy B> and his family.
[2015-08-18 05:46:58] <WISE Up Action> Re media framing and imbalance: Like the intense demand for anonymity for complainant (even when they’ve outed themselves!), but not for defendant.
[2015-08-18 05:47:58] <Emmy B> Before I forget, record of Christine Ann Sands UK conviction can be found here: https://archive.is/JO8lc
[2015-08-18 05:48:03] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, that’s an important point re JA & his family. Also, the damage to real victims when someone falsely accuses
[2015-08-18 05:48:29] <LibertarianLibrarian> Good too that we can point out the site is false.
[2015-08-18 05:52:22] <WikiLeaks> Check out the sort of creature Fritz is: http://www.advokatfritz.com/
[2015-08-18 05:53:39] <Emmy B> a better archived link https://archive.is/BDJYw
[2015-08-18 05:54:05] <WikiLeaks> A few years ago in Sweden they intruced a measure which superficially sounds reasonable, to provide alleged victims with their own state funded lawyers.
[2015-08-18 05:54:58] <WISE Up Action> Gawdelpus! (Fritz) Says everything
[2015-08-18 05:55:53] <WikiLeaks> However, look at how it works in practice. The accused is up against a state funded team from the prosecution, another from the police, and, say in JA’s case, another two state funded lawyers for the accusers.
[2015-08-18 05:56:44] <Emmy B> I thought she was a Christian Syriac from (what is now) Turkey, Active within the Syriac Community of Sweden.
[2015-08-18 05:57:36] <Emmy B> A media Lawyer, political connections.
[2015-08-18 05:58:17] <WISE Up Action> It doesn’t take 5 seconds to see that is an obvious abuse of justice. Imagine it being a black geezer in the States and a white complainant.
[2015-08-18 05:58:55] <WikiLeaks> In terms of the process and law, there’s only three things the state funded accusers lawyers can do:
1) massage the text of the complaint to ensure it has all the necessay elements to secure a conviction. In Sweden that’s strong, since the “complaint” can always be resubmitted.
[2015-08-18 06:00:22] <WikiLeaks> 2) advice the accuser on how not to be convicted for false reporting, for example, asking for advice about an HIV test rather than making a complaint
[2015-08-18 06:01:25] <WikiLeaks> 3) public relations. For example, nearly all of Borgstrom’s bill was for speaking to journalists. Just for SW he billed for 80 hours of interviews. Normally lawyers do interviews for free, since it is free advertising for them.
[2015-08-18 06:02:24] <WikiLeaks> So the accusation industry is highly profitable. Almost nothing to do other than bill the state for advertising your own law firm.
[2015-08-18 06:03:03] <WISE Up Action> Smarmy git
[2015-08-18 06:03:22] <WikiLeaks> Fritz practice just does accusation work. Hence she’s made a lot of money and expanded rapidly. As long as she can keep cases going and keep them in the spotlight, she makes more money.
[2015-08-18 06:04:21] <Emmy B> A blatant disregard for the essence of justice
[2015-08-18 06:04:25] <WikiLeaks> She works closely with NY, who now handles all ‘rape’ cases in Sweden. Together thay tag-team the accused.
[2015-08-18 06:04:50] <WISE Up Action> She’s like a fifth rate US TV show
[2015-08-18 06:05:53] <Emmy B> Like Borgstrom and the Quick case in reverse, not really caring for their client in relation to real justice, just focusing on getting a judicial result irrespective of truth
[2015-08-18 06:06:52] <Emmy B> SW’s interests as a person have certainly not been served by such protracted case and her own lawyer campaigning against JA being interviewed in London.
[2015-08-18 06:07:44] <Emmy B> I recall the fritz campaign in early 2014 on the subject to not question JA in London
[2015-08-18 06:08:17] <Emmy B> She played politics not serving justice.
[2015-08-18 06:09:37] <Emmy B> If there is evidence of collaboration between Ny and Fritz, we already know Ny contacted Expressen for a PR stand in London, then where are the 4 pillars of democracy in Sweden?
[2015-08-18 06:09:38] <WISE Up Action> What a hideous PR firm that is – Ny + Fritz. Bet they’ve never spoken to a working class poor woman in their lives
[2015-08-18 06:10:28] <Emmy B> Are they collaborating in managing a legal outcome? they are supposed to be independent.
[2015-08-18 06:11:18] <Emmy B> Why is it that The Guardian US is leading this and not The Guardian UK?
[2015-08-18 06:11:43] <Emmy B> Do they wish to by-pass UK libel laws maybe?
[2015-08-18 06:13:54] <Emmy B> Let’s do some research….
[2015-08-18 06:16:16] <Emmy B> I cannot find http://sofiawilen.com
[2015-08-18 06:20:25] <Emmy B> it redirects to http://pentagonmoney.com
[2015-08-18 06:24:18] <Emmy B> I am sorry Valenti has written as far back as Dec 2010 on the Assange case.
[2015-08-18 06:24:24] <Emmy B> http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/10/AR2010121002571.html
[2015-08-18 06:28:38] <WikiLeaks> Look at Borgstrom’s bill. He even billed the state for reading NY-JA lawyers correspondence. In other words NY was forwarding the defence correspondence. However the defence never received a single letter of NY-Borgstrom. They were also in lock-step about the decision to interview/not interview.
[2015-08-18 06:30:25] <WikiLeaks> So the toxic Sands has just removed http://sofiawilen.com
[2015-08-18 06:33:51] <Emmy B> Re Sands, the article I appended here of her conviction proves she is activein other ’causes’ in an agressive manner and has convictions. On another topic, Valenti might have scraped her twitter record regarding her Assange tweets
[2015-08-18 06:35:45] <Emmy B> I just came across only two tweets, one as a re-tweet of her previous article on Assange, the other I just archived here: https://archive.is/7QPTM

[2015-08-18 06:52:58] <Emmy B> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/JessicaValenti/status/369088049956663297 yes i found some more: here she jumps to conclusions about JA’s position on abortion
[2015-08-18 06:53:12] <WikiLeaks> We have more detail. The article is about 2k words. It is straight prosecution/fritz line. It goes through a chronology at the beginning and looks to set the scene to counter-act SW’s statements, for example, saying how she went to hospital to get a “rape kit” before going to police.
[2015-08-18 06:55:31] <Emmy B> Does it mention the fact her case was dismissed outright from the stockholm prosecutor?
[2015-08-18 06:55:51] <Emmy B> as a ‘non case’
[2015-08-18 06:56:00] <noll> on the motives behind JV’s campus piece: http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/04/rolling-stone-rape-reporting-disaster-bias.html
[2015-08-18 06:56:19] <WikiLeaks> No. Nothing like that is mentioned. No positive elements at all.
[2015-08-18 06:56:49] <WikiLeaks> “rape kit” seems to have just been an STDtest re-named.
[2015-08-18 06:58:49] <WikiLeaks> Yes, we believe Guardian will likely publish via US to avoid libel laws. Public figures are unable to sue for libel unless malice can be proved.
[2015-08-18 06:59:10] <M> Helen Lewis had a piece a few days ago that had a similar taste – it went off on how the women have been called sluts, liars, etc, which is damaging, but made no comment as to how damaging the label rapist is on someone who has not been convicted. Luckily, it didn’t seem to gain much traction and is now stuck behind a paywall.
[2015-08-18 06:59:45] <WikiLeaks> do you have a copy of the Lewis article?
[2015-08-18 07:01:26] <M> I’ll have to search for one. Didn’t expect it to go under paywall.
[2015-08-18 07:03:39] <WikiLeaks> One positive is that we hear that there is debate within the Guardian, and there is a significant faction that are very suspicious about the whole case and how they’re being instrumentalized.
[2015-08-18 07:05:58] <WISE Up Action> Oh that is EXCELLENT news
[2015-08-18 07:07:30] <Emmy B> I found the link on Valenti tweets about ‘let’s talk about it’ she has taken it down from her blog I think as current URL cannot be found, but in the wayback machine it is all there: she is sponsoring the #letstalkaboutit anti-Assange campaign and encourages others to participate:

[2015-08-18 07:28:41] <Emmy B> three more Valenti articles from her blog on Assange have been deleted but here they are, maybe there is something in the comments she did not want kept?

[2015-08-18 07:31:23] <Emmy B> interestingly, one of her posts has been translated into Swedish (?) here: https://genusnytt.wordpress.com/2010/12/13/varldsberomd-feminist-hanar-anklagelserna-mot-assange/
[2015-08-18 07:32:50] <Emmy B> I will keep an eye!
[2015-08-18 07:44:49] <WikiLeaks> Any idea as to when they were deleted?
[2015-08-18 07:45:09] <noll> here’s two main pieces: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/06/jackie-uva-rape-details-rolling-stone-reporthttp://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/24/inconsistencies-jackie-story-rolling-stone-rape
[2015-08-18 07:45:10] <WikiLeaks> She’s likely preparing shop for her campaign.

[2015-08-18 13:41:13] <Emmy B> thank you, just looking at jezebel one 🙂
[2015-08-18 13:42:48] <Emmy B> H what do you think? a- here she misrepresents JA’s views, it is a blatant lie easily disproved still a toxic lie that made the rounds at the time:

[2015-08-18 13:48:16] <Emmy B> “And despite reports to the contrary, Assange’s accusers have always said that this was not consensual sex.” (hyperlinking in ‘always said’) this Guardian article https://web.archive.org/web/20121229121343/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/aug/24/assange-wikileaks-swedish-prosecutors-charges
[2015-08-18 13:49:18] <Emmy B> I view her as someone who will use quotes/articles and misquote or misrepresent them so as to create backing for her point of view.
[2015-08-18 13:50:15] <Emmy B> If SW has given an interview Valenti may misrepresent and misquote to prove her point. What do you think?
[2015-08-18 14:01:17] <Emmy B> Sorry I forgot the original article where she participates on #talkaboutit

[2015-08-18 14:05:51] <noll> the quote is “non-violence in terms of abortion” and JA is stating their position – & not his own, which is.. (watch another minute Valenti..) “I think the world is often more complex”. the “pre-Roe” thing refers to: http://www.yalelawjournal.org/feature/before-and-after-roe-v-wade-new-questions-about-backlash
[2015-08-18 14:14:29] <Emmy B> thanx!
[2015-08-18 14:15:17] <Emmy B> a good rebuttal of her washington post article: http://reason.com/archives/2010/12/22/julian-assange-feminism-and-ra
[2015-08-18 14:54:11] <WISE Up Action> Thanks, Em – that’s useful. Valenti seems to be one of those ‘conflaters’ amongst other things, which is a particularly sloppy and/or devious way of arguing a point that becomes very difficult to rebut (having to pull the strands apart is long-winded and people lose interest/think it’s fussing with detail – which of course ‘the devil is in..!’
[2015-08-18 15:00:31] <LibertarianLibrarian> She may not be worth rebutting. Might be better to ignore and just keep getting the truth out as widely as possible. Let her fall over her own culpability and malevolence.
[2015-08-18 15:02:23] <LibertarianLibrarian> On the other hand, it might be worth well-publicizing Fritz’s ‘accuser’ attorney money-making scheme. It’s a very bizarre thing.
[2015-08-18 15:03:52] <LibertarianLibrarian> Borgstrom has an earned himself an awful reputation; wouldn’t be surprised to see Fritz similarly disliked/distrusted.
[2015-08-18 15:04:43] <LibertarianLibrarian> Push the corruption side of her earning her money through publicity not legal work.
[2015-08-18 15:17:14] <WikiLeaks> Here is what we are considering releasing. Comments? https://justice4assange.com/On-SW-s-Interview.html
[2015-08-18 15:17:56] <WISE Up Action> That site of hers (Fritz) is really something. They so look like they’re about to start singing and dancing in some 80s (Collins) musical extravaganza. It just exudes the epitome of everything that ISN’T really feminist ffs
[2015-08-18 15:25:07] <WikiLeaks> Money, influence, glamour for women helping women imprison men. It may not be your type of feminism, but they don’t cae.
[2015-08-18 15:31:19] <WISE Up Action> I started reading the statement thinking ‘Oh no, don’t preempt…’, but after reading it, I do think it’s really very good – well selected content. It also manages to sound authoritative, brooking no nonsense, and very calm. Will carry on reading through it thinking about detail.
[2015-08-18 15:33:43] <WikiLeaks> In a press war you should almost always pre-empt.
[2015-08-18 15:35:00] <WISE Up Action> OK, but I meant preempt an answer to what you don’t know you’re answering!!
[2015-08-18 15:36:24] <WISE Up Action> (eg as in a sort of rebuttal) however this is not that ofc
[2015-08-18 15:51:04] <WISE Up Action> Yes, I think it is excellent from the point of view of being very straightforward too, and it sticks to salient points which carry a great deal of conviction.
It’s also easy to read yet, as well, manages to contain a great deal of info which, with the mass of misinformation that’s abroad, will be news to many. Thus (as WLs said earlier) hopefully igniting a more profitable discussion.

[2015-08-18 15:59:43] <noll> agree. / would be amusing to put “JV self-described “feminist evangelist” & author of ‘Why Have Kids?’..” at the start.. (please don’t!) review: “The book itself is split into two parts: “Lies” (including “Children Make You Happy,” “Women Are the Natural Parent,” “Breast is Best,” “Children Need Their Parents,” “‘The Hardest Job in the World’,” and “MOther Knows Best”) and “Truth” (including “Giving Up on Parenthood,” “‘Bad’ Mothers Go to Jail,” “Smart Women Don’t Have Kids,” “Death of the Nuclear Family,” “Women Should Work,” and “Why Have Kids?”). Those titles themselves speak for themselves on how the author seems to view parenting.” http://www.amazon.com/Why-Have-Kids-Parenting-Happiness/product-reviews/0547892616/ref=cm_cr_dp_qt_hist_one/176-9522678-0431658?ie=UTF8&filterBy=addOneStar&showViewpoints=0

[2015-08-18 16:16:03] <WISE Up Action> Ta.
One of the reviews on the Amazon page: “She also had an uncomfortable amount of forum and blog post entries as credible sources, quoting people like “Jessica Wabbit” which is the kind of thing I wouldn’t have even tried to get away with in my high school research papers.”
[2015-08-18 17:01:26] <WISE Up Action> I think she should have had the courage and nouse to write a personal testimony instead of trying to frame it as a book of universals. As a personal perspective it would have credibility; there’s a place for writing in an extreme way about situations like that – it has its own emotional truth. But you should never ever write it into a polemic imo.
Plainly it’s a crap book and she’s a shit, lazy writer and researcher.
On motherhood as the ultimate feminine trait I agree and don’t in equal measure and it would be an essay…not for here – tho I’d love to engage w/it!

[2015-08-18 23:01:21] <WISE Up Action> Night x (well, morning actually!)
[2015-08-18 23:09:14] <Emmy B> Thx, good morning from me, off to the bakery for fresh Galaktobureko yumm! on a lighter note, read comments here: https://archive.is/zWqKN

[2015-08-19 01:20:44] <Emmy B> If Valenti mentions the sofiawilen website imagine how prolific Chrisitne will be, finally making the international press
[2015-08-19 01:21:11] <Emmy B> Should I make a blog post about her and send it to David Crouch?
[2015-08-19 01:25:16] <Emmy B> In the past we had discussed not to include her in troll lists or delve on her activities as she was so prolific, it would only feed her obsession and encourage her. But if this person is to receive international attention in a Valenti article then surely we should not let her be presented as the representative sample of WLsup – Thank you very much.
[2015-08-19 04:45:02] <WikiLeaks> Sands has made negative comments about JA/WL
[2015-08-19 05:00:09] <Emmy B> And many negative comments about his supporters, I might have to unblock her accounts so I can actually see & collect her tweets.
[2015-08-19 05:58:07] <LibertarianLibrarian> Morning all. I’m not familiar with Sands. As she’s obviously unstable, clearly establishing that she’s a fringe nut job is probably a good idea.
[2015-08-19 05:59:39] <LibertarianLibrarian> I couldn’t get the http://justice4assange.com
[2015-08-19 06:07:15] <WikiLeaks> In what way did it fail?
[2015-08-19 06:11:29] <LibertarianLibrarian> I got a blank page, with both firefox and chrome. Could be my phone though, let me try on the desktop.
[2015-08-19 06:13:43] <LibertarianLibrarian> Nope, same on desktop in both browsers. Disabling privacy badger, ghostery and https everywhere didn’t help.
[2015-08-19 06:15:29] <WikiLeaks> And what url?

[2015-08-19 06:18:51] <LibertarianLibrarian> The base sites work for both .com and .org, so it’s not just a US-blocking or something bizarre like that.
[2015-08-19 06:21:17] <WikiLeaks> the url is

[2015-08-19 06:30:06] <LibertarianLibrarian> Got it and yes, it takes just the right tone. Sets out the facts clearly while avoiding the kind of polemic that Valenti is likely to toss out. Is it ready to share now?
[2015-08-19 06:32:57] <LibertarianLibrarian> Looks like it is, awesome!

[2015-08-19 07:07:24] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/tomwatson/status/634001138291994624 JA-haters are rallying the troops
[2015-08-19 07:16:19] <LibertarianLibrarian> Considering how many strong, intelligent, professional women support JA, the whole ‘anti-feminist’ thing is a complete joke. But rabid feminists of this sort refuse to listen to anything that counters their ideology, even if it comes from other women.
[2015-08-19 07:17:14] <LibertarianLibrarian> I just got my ticket to the 9/8 Verso Books event! It’s a nuisance drive into Brooklyn, ~50 miles that will take closer to 2 hours, but worth it!
[2015-08-19 07:46:42] <Emmy B> I don’t even see this as a feminist dialectic issue, once a matter completely veers off the most basic of facts then it is only an opportunity to bully and spit on others as a tool of social exclusion.
[2015-08-19 07:51:53] <Emmy B> When as a child once was asked to offer my chair to my brother as he entered the room so as to sit next to the fire. There was no logic or fact required, reason had nothing to do with it. I had to make space for him and I did. Such articles that I have read JV producing is telling the world there is no space close to the fire for JA, others have to sit there. It is a social exclusion that aims to the physical and intellectual disappearance of the other from a space they wish to dominate.
[2015-08-19 07:54:22] <Emmy B> It is not about the truth or the facts or the protection of others or philosophising about ethics and morals, it is all about complete exclusion from the social/political space that they themselves wish to not just occupy but dominate.
[2015-08-19 07:58:49] <Emmy B> Unfortunately the Guardian has proved again and again that as an organisation wishes to dominate that space by the fire, see the contempt they treat Jeremy Corbyn. But JV may not be a suitable banner bearer, I expect her article to be heavily edited as it would not stand to scrutiny. Her only gravitas will be carrying SW voice, a great shame.
[2015-08-19 08:01:38] <Emmy B> Mrs Fritz cannot have her client’s best interest at heart to be arranging such collaboration, literally throwing her name on the ring of public scrutiny when she knows there is nothing to be gained.
[2015-08-19 08:06:07] <LibertarianLibrarian> That makes a lot of sense, Emmy. It’s not about the issue itself but their own power and recognition and the ability to push others down. I’ve seen that in many other areas too, it’s just that I’ve had personal run-ins with too many feminists like that. But it can happen anywhere insecure people need attention & domination of others to build up their own self-image.
[2015-08-19 08:06:57] <Emmy B> And there confirms once again the politicisation of the case. I wonder will it be a bit like what MGT attempted to do with the Steinitz journo at the Stern….and having his lawyer giving quotes etc. Let’s see because now, with the AA case dropped and SW case remaining maybe it will be easier to sue for defaming and finally through this lawsuit get access to the MSM messages in the case file, so guarded by Ny?
[2015-08-19 08:07:18] <WISE Up Action> It is the use of tools of social exclusion (oppression) that are perceived to have been (and be being) used against them. What (as Bella puts it) ‘old-skool feminism’ does is reject those tools altogether.
Experience shld be heard and has it’s own legitimate space, and this is of its essence an emotional space – people’s personal narrative is a vital part of the truth. That can be as expressed in as extreme a way as people’s emotions are. It’s the stuff of poetry, memoir, art etc
What this stuff does is to place that emotional violence in a journalistic space and ask it to be recognised as objective.
[2015-08-19 08:07:53] <LibertarianLibrarian> Mrs Fritz has only been out for herself from the start. She’s been somewhat in the background compared to Borgstrom, because of his public profile and history, but now she can get the attention regardless of the impact on her ‘client’.
[2015-08-19 08:15:49] <LibertarianLibrarian> I think it’s also a fallacy to say that journalism is ‘objective’ except in cases where the evidence is clearly and openly provided, as Wikileaks has sought to do by making all documents available. Yet, even the straight out “x happened” can be shaded by personal bias. That’s a big issue in research and it reminds me of the difference between ‘analytic’ or ‘quantitative’ studies vs qualitative studies, where the latter deliberately explore personal experience and narrative. The issue is that even the best ‘analytic’ research always has some level of potential bias and when evaluating it, the risk of bias must be considered.
I’d rather see journalists who are capable of recognizing and accounting for their personal biases, willing to minimize those by providing documentary evidence, but without the false pretense of objectivity, as it seems that those who cry the loudest about being objective are usually the most biased.
[2015-08-19 08:19:52] <WISE Up Action> OK – objective probably not the right word – I just mean analytical
[2015-08-19 08:21:05] <Emmy B> We can’t escape wishing to control the narrative when we write an opinion paper, this is hardly a dialogue it is an opinion wishing to influence. If we see this as a march, who would be persuaded to follow the ambitious lawyer with the glitchy suit, screaming money and success? The emotionally charged journalist who holds the hand of what she presents to the world to be a child but in fact is a fully grown woman. The story is five years old and the march has taken a different direction long time ago. Of course there are interests to be served that push to influence events politically as this case has been politicised. But the more narrow the spectrum they focus on the more evident these become.
[2015-08-19 08:22:43] <Emmy B> M has shared an interesting tweet so we already know who in twitter will jump into the ‘debate’ but there is as per usual no real ‘debate’. The only objective is knock JA/WL down off that cosy space by the fire.
[2015-08-19 08:24:00] <WISE Up Action> Do we know when the ‘opinion piece’ is coming out? I can’t remember if it’s been discussed already.
[2015-08-19 08:25:31] <Emmy B> We don’t know. Wait and see.
[2015-08-19 08:27:00] <WISE Up Action> Obviously, the most interesting thing to anyone who isn’t committed to bias already and hasn’t made up their mind what they think, will be SW’s contribution…and that is pretty much a complete unknown I guess
[2015-08-19 08:27:48] <Emmy B> It will not be from the horses mouth though.
[2015-08-19 08:28:15] <WISE Up Action> How d’you mean?
[2015-08-19 08:28:41] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, it will be interesting to see whether what she says now matches up to those early tweets & texts and how they will attempt to play a change.
[2015-08-19 08:29:29] <WISE Up Action> You mean her words will be presented to suit the agenda, Em? By Valenti?
[2015-08-19 08:30:19] <Emmy B> well, having seen how Valenti misrepresents a JA’s views (referring to a video as proof when the video disproves her point) as I mentioned above yesterday, when she refered to JA’s interview about Ron /Rand Paul
[2015-08-19 08:31:48] <Emmy B> , Having seen again how in one of her posts she hyperlinks to the guardian article as proof of her claim but when you go to the article you do not find that proof but the opposite
[2015-08-19 08:32:54] <Emmy B> I wonder how much of the SW real views we will get to read for ourselves as a substantial quote or are we just going to be ‘served up’ a fillet cut and tailored to suit JV’s agenda
[2015-08-19 08:33:26] <WISE Up Action> That kind of disingenuous/sloppy linking/conflating is referred to specifically by several reviewers of her books
[2015-08-19 08:34:57] <Emmy B> or maybe it will be a Q&A where easily a journo can lead the interviewee to say the bits they are looking to hear… hmmm if that is her case with her books then quite possibly we may not get to hear SW’s voice.
[2015-08-19 08:34:58] <LibertarianLibrarian> If she continues that kind of sloppy misinformation, it certainly gives open room for factual corrections.
[2015-08-19 08:36:04] <WISE Up Action> Trouble is the detail you have to go into is often in itself a distraction – people lose interest/think you’re being picky
[2015-08-19 08:37:11] <Emmy B> Anyway it could be that it will be the lawyer Fritz transferring SW’s voice as in the case of Borgstom telling the journos what AA said, so she could at any time deny it or become hearsay rather than a testament.
[2015-08-19 08:37:35] <LibertarianLibrarian> So you select out a couple of obvious examples and then ‘wonder’ about the accuracy of the rest of it.
That could very well be, Emmy.
[2015-08-19 08:40:14] <Emmy B> How often we have seen amongst trolls that they take a complete sentence, even a true sentence that someone has wrote, and put it into a context that it appears to be a believable lie. At the Fake forum this has been done constantly. A rule of misinformation if you like. It could be SW’s quotes are also used in this way, we don’t know.
[2015-08-19 08:40:52] <WISE Up Action> Yeh – sometimes works but pretty hard not to lose pple’s interest being too complex in a tweet.
Good point abt hearsay, Em
[2015-08-19 08:41:09] <WISE Up Action> ie legally
[2015-08-19 08:42:31] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, taking things out of context is a common ploy. How much of that have we seen already? All we can do is try to point to the true context.
[2015-08-19 08:43:15] <WISE Up Action> And that’s my point about complexity – that sort of deviousness quite effective for reasons I just said. Why I often think sticking to the salient and key factual points best strategy
[2015-08-19 08:45:24] <WISE Up Action> If V’s piece like Steinitz – who was trying to say JA responsible for/encouraged maligning of women by ‘supporters’ that’s an easy point to refute – why shld he be responsible for that?
[2015-08-19 08:45:54] <LibertarianLibrarian> True, it is hard to make more complex things clear in tweets or the more simple social media.
[2015-08-19 08:46:27] <LibertarianLibrarian> Well, we’ll have to see what her piece actually contains and then carefully pick targets, if needed.
[2015-08-19 08:47:24] <Emmy B> I agree! with first point WiseUp and this is all we can do, stick to the facts. Perhaps they will talk about ‘a cult’ again. Also agree with Jenny. But let’s also see how the article will be used in the US, in the UK in Sweden. It will be a starting point for other publications to refer to it and in the process further filter the message to fit the objective. In the UK due to the clear position of the UK government.
[2015-08-19 08:48:11] <Emmy B> (they have accused Ecuador of preventing due process to take place influencing judicial outcome)
[2015-08-19 08:49:00] <WISE Up Action> Agreed – gotta go cook for 11 of us – ugh
[2015-08-19 08:49:30] <Emmy B> happy cooking xxx

[2015-08-19 09:47:22] <WikiLeaks> Yes, it is foolish. She will include them in her article and spin their context.

[2015-08-19 18:19:03] <noll> on the surface JV makes many compelling points, but how accurate are they? when the bias is clear w/ her primary example: “The protests are part of a larger nationwide movement to reform campus sexual assault policies – one whose necessity is exemplified by Sabrina Rubin Erdely’s recent Rolling Stone feature on a harrowing sexual assault at a University of Virginia fraternity” http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/how-carry-that-weight-is-changing-the-conversation-on-campus-sexual-assault-20141201https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/04/24/columbia-university-sued-by-male-student-in-carry-that-weight-rape-case/http://dailycaller.com/2015/04/24/the-text-of-the-mattress-girl-lawsuit-will-shock-you/

[2015-08-19 18:20:43] <WikiLeaks> She’s picked the wrong horse on all the big recent cases.
[2015-08-19 18:27:33] <noll> agree. but in short-term, it often depends on who & why various parties are willing to carry, or follow this type of horse – & it always ends w/: a means to enable self-interested ends.

[2015-08-20 07:58:20] <Emmy B> Since I unblocked her this morning my interactions time line is spammed with her messages, not responding. I am writing to Alison Earle from London Live who interviewed me in March outside the embassy during our solidarity vigil marking 1000 days of JA at the embassy. She witnessed Sands behaviour and how upset, concerned we felt. At the time Alison Earle had herself observed that such behaviour stood out as fake. I am asking for advise, maybe rather than just writing a blog post on the matter, myself and others who knew her here in London issue together a press statement for publication. If Sands name is mentioned in the JV article. We can distance ourselves and condemn her behaviour, not through twitter tittle tattle but properly in a considered and convincing way, eponymously.
[2015-08-20 08:05:14] <Emmy B> Half a dozen people would be happy to do so I am sure.
[2015-08-20 11:31:19] <WikiLeaks> We suspect JV article will be Saturday now.
[2015-08-20 12:01:59] <LibertarianLibrarian> That’s smart Emmy.
[2015-08-20 12:42:58] <WISE Up Action> Gobsmacked by all the rape stuff. No idea all that was going down. Cannot believe all those people losing their heads that should be (whose specific job is to be) keeping them level. Now I get yr reference to Crucible, H – didn’t know wtf you were on about. Like recovered memory syndrome too. Should ALWAYS be sus when due process & research standards being undermined. Who can it possibly help?? Aside from even the damage to the falsely accused, if any ‘Emma’ is not bringing the truth, this just locks them in to their damage – how can they possibly recant and find any healing when users are pinning a ‘movement’ on their shoulders? Really distressing.
[2015-08-20 12:49:20] <WikiLeaks> Fast multi-party communications leads to mob dynamics.
[2015-08-20 12:53:41] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, that’s a good point. We do see mob dynamics at work in social media – like the reverse side of rapid spread of news and activism.
[2015-08-20 12:57:29] <WISE Up Action> The very particular thing I value about the spirit of Occupy was what it was always criticised for. As in not coming up with a manifesto.
[2015-08-20 15:29:37] <WikiLeaks> It was criticized for not having a manifesto, because the establishment press wanted something to attack it with its manifesto. It surely would have died even sooner if it had one.
[2015-08-20 15:53:19] <noll> Action, we were also really surprised by all of this, didn’t fully cotton on until the ‘feminist’/ ‘liberal’ content wars jumped the latest media barrier. guess a few things are comparable – but witch trials began w/ a “listen & believe” approach (which was politically useful to the establishment), & ended via an enlightenment insistence on actual evidence/ proof. see last 10 mins of: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv-JDUfADiwhttps://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2sya8r/can_someone_explain_the_context_behind_listen_and/
[2015-08-20 16:55:03] <WISE Up Action> http://wiseupaction.info/parody-of-clever/
[2015-08-20 18:43:47] <noll> https://wikileaks.org/plusd/?qproject[]=cc&qproject[]=fp&q=&qforigin=Iran%23%23Tehran&qtfrom=1979-11-04&qtto=1981-12-31#result
[2015-08-20 18:52:24] <WISE Up Action> Yep. Access to primary sources invaluable. Cuts all the crap. And cuts right across the whole appallingly cynical media/public discourse. As that Buckminster Fuller quote says, a ‘new model’ is the thing that makes the ‘old model obsolete’ – plus the historical record preserved is life-blood critical. Wahey for WikiLeaks!
Parody wasn’t written recently or in response to this convo, but WLs saying the press constantly snarked at Occupy so they could pin it down to take it down reminded me of some of the lines. And also the shallowness/soundbite speech of this ‘rape-culture’ movement makes it, in essence, cynical. And doubtless what we’ll get in the w/e Graun fr V.
On ‘Listen & Believe’, you can ‘listen & believe in’ a person’s humanity, pain etc w/o accepting or rejecting their stated interpretation of how they’re feeling. And diving in on that extremity of emotion & seizing it for your own reasons/agenda/pain without giving it space is the essence of poor counselling.
[2015-08-21 03:34:53] <WikiLeaks> WL wouldn’t last 5 minutes if we addopted ‘listen and believe’.
[2015-08-21 03:40:29] <Emmy B> Thank goodness, please continue doing what you do and under no circumstances do otherwise, counting on you to be different <3
[2015-08-21 03:41:04] <Emmy B> and keep surprising the world 🙂
[2015-08-21 05:51:12] <LibertarianLibrarian> Absolutely. That’s the fundamental in my field, the whole basis for evidence-based healthcare – moving from ‘x’ authority did it that way to the research evidence demonstrates to do it this way.
[2015-08-21 05:51:44] <LibertarianLibrarian> I spend a lot of my time teaching people how to critically examine research evidence.
[2015-08-21 05:52:23] <LibertarianLibrarian> Too bad they don’t teach it as well to journalists these days as they do to medical students.
[2015-08-21 05:53:38] <LibertarianLibrarian> That’s why Wikileaks’ (JA’s) concept of scientific journalism is so important and so impactfull.
[2015-08-21 05:54:23] <LibertarianLibrarian> Is impactfull a word? Tired on Friday morning in the middle of fall faculty orientation sessions. Boring!
[2015-08-21 07:59:18] <Emmy B> 🙂
[2015-08-21 09:03:14] <WISE Up Action> ‘WikiLeaks Files’ just arrived
[2015-08-21 09:16:50] <noll> interesting.. https://twitter.com/hazelpress/status/634760963997237248
[2015-08-21 09:25:42] <noll> if anyone’s documenting Sands, would definitely capture some of the latest. https://twitter.com/SheriffSands/status/634743624501227520
[2015-08-21 09:29:40] <Emmy B> I am not documenting any of her tweets
[2015-08-21 09:30:30] <Emmy B> Her behaviour screams ‘give me attention’ WL supporters, I want your interactions.
[2015-08-21 09:32:04] <WISE Up Action> Even one or two like that wld be sufficient evidence for anyone!! She makes no contact with us at all. Never replied fr the start.
[2015-08-21 09:32:06] <Emmy B> To see Sands and MGT in direct communication is not surprising.
[2015-08-21 15:51:23] <M> New SvD hit piece against JA: http://www.svd.se/darfor-ar-alla-sura-pa-julian-assange/om/lardomar-fran-veckan
[2015-08-21 16:19:34] <WISE Up Action> It’s pretty childish goss, isn’t it? JA is persona non grata becos he stays up all night and eats takeaways. And refers to Times Diary piece which was just a short v silly para. Jerks.
This (only attempt at *facts* of note) sounds vastly exaggerated tho but maybe translation errors?:
‘the creditors who lost millions when he fled to the Embassy of Ecuador, the publishing company that paid out even more millions in advance for an autobiography he never wrote clear, or the British police that lurpassande outside Embassy goes on 130,000 dollars a day.’
[2015-08-21 23:27:59] <M> Pretty hilarious f-up by Louise Mensch: http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/22/louise-menschs-bid-to-smear-jeremy-corbyn-backfires
[2015-08-22 04:36:47] <noll> ‘Nazi-inspired’ anti-immigration group becomes Sweden’s most popular party. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/naziinspired-antiimmigration-group-becomes-swedens-most-popular-party-10465862.html
[2015-08-22 06:20:18] <Emmy B> This is what oppositional politics cause: it very own opposition political movement. Eurogroup’s victory over Tsipras with his capitulation to its demands has split Syriza and Greece now has a new mainstream political party of the Left clearly open to Grexit. With 20th of Sep the election day we won’t have to wait long to see whether the 32 MP rebels will get re-elected and how much support will Tsipras still hold.
[2015-08-22 08:49:03] <WISE Up Action> ‘Jackson visits Assange’ balcony pic top lhs c.3″x5″ near middle of Sat Graun (main section) – no text, just neutral caption

[2015-08-23 01:24:04] <Emmy B> I think JA’s latest speech in France is embedded in this article. http://blogs.mediapart.fr/blog/edwy-plenel/230815/en-defense-des-lanceurs-d-alerte
[2015-08-24 01:45:45] <Emmy B> Valenti has not tweeted since justice4assange issued press release on Forthcoming Opinion Piece in the Guardian 18.08.2015

[2015-08-25 06:41:51] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/MarinaHyde/status/636133157440503808 Amusing fight between Guardian columnist Marina Hyde and Greenwald/Media Lens.
[2015-08-25 06:45:35] <M> Also, bizarre attack on the entirety of the left (incl., of course, JA supporters) by Sarah Ditum, who is no stranger to attacks on JA. https://archive.is/SnvJp#selection-1003.290-1003.379
[2015-08-25 06:46:32] <LibertarianLibrarian> Welcome Greta!
[2015-08-25 06:46:52] <LibertarianLibrarian> That is a really bizarre article by Ditum.
[2015-08-25 07:40:37] <voidiss> Yes, I agree, Ditum’s article is really strange as an attack. It can be also interesting from another point of view, but the low blows against Assange and supporters are always the same and they’re put in even when they have nothing to do with the article itself. Also, I think Hyde’s “joke” is very telling: it isn’t a proper criticism so MediaLens can’t answer back, but still it pushes a dangerous (and too much rooted) smear. When they don’t know how to attack they use the “conspiracy/paranoia” card.
[2015-08-25 07:40:49] <voidiss> (Thank you Jenny!)
[2015-08-25 08:00:39] <WikiLeaks> We hear Guardian are very nervous about the JV article. So either its likely to have been massively expanded with a news reporter or its been killed.
[2015-08-25 08:32:41] <WikiLeaks> Andrew Golis @agolis, is not just JV’s husband and not just anti-JA. He was involved in the PBS documentary attack on WL. After airing it, PBS was hacked by anons in response and forced to issue a humiliating press release stating that Tupac was alive and found in New Zealand.
[2015-08-25 09:56:45] <M> Guardian/Gitmo article avoids citing WL; says “long-neglected US military capture information”, which links to Miami Herald, instead of to WL directly.
[2015-08-25 09:59:22] <LibertarianLibrarian> All of which is typical of the Guardian.
[2015-08-25 10:03:47] <LibertarianLibrarian> I could see that JV’s ‘style’ of rather unsubtle assaultive writing could make them nervous.
[2015-08-25 10:23:19] <WISE Up Action> Hello, Greta. Welcome!
[2015-08-25 10:35:46] <voidiss> Their nervousness for JV’s article shows that they know the piece is going to be full of lies/smears and so they feel the pressure of having
[2015-08-25 10:35:53] <voidiss> to handle it properly, saving their face. If they kill it after http://justice4assange.com
[2015-08-25 14:11:16] <Emmy B> Very interesting info about @ agolis
[2015-08-25 14:14:08] <Emmy B> An SW interview is highly monetisable if not literally in selling it onwards, at least in bringing traffic onto their site and getting quoted by others as well as hyperlinked.
[2015-08-25 14:14:56] <Emmy B> Ie if they have it, they will somehow monetise it/ use it, one way or another.
[2015-08-25 14:16:30] <Emmy B> On another issue, not the first time that I notice MGT interacting with James Ball.
[2015-08-25 14:16:53] <WikiLeaks> When?
[2015-08-25 14:19:13] <Emmy B> 24th – https://archive.is/61vsi
[2015-08-25 14:26:54] <WikiLeaks> Well spotted; likely trying to do a deal over the alleged ecuadorian intel docs published in Focus Ecuador
[2015-08-25 14:39:37] <Emmy B> MGT has been having them translated and posted in his site.
[2015-08-25 14:41:56] <Emmy B> He is a proven prolific liar, manufacturer of lies, anything he propagates I see with the greatest suspicion.
[2015-08-25 14:52:40] <voidiss> As has been noted, the article on Focus Ecuador was written by Villavicencio, who was convicted of defaming Correa and fled to US. I’m not commenting on his case, I’m just pointing out that US are surely very willing to use him as symbol of ‘bad Ecuador’s skewed free press right’ and that probably, since they’re hosting him, he’s playing by their side and has interest in writing an article like that. Surely MGT is super happy of it, so he can use it to smear over and over.
[2015-08-25 14:56:41] <WikiLeaks> MGT is small fry; no-one follows him and almost no-one reads his nonsense on the fake WLF. However, his “outreach” activities do need to be watched.
[2015-08-25 15:04:05] <Emmy B> Sadly I do read his nonsense and will be keeping an eye as per usual.
[2015-08-25 15:05:12] <voidiss> Yes, his site is really absurd and exaggerated, it’d be impossible for people to believe it. But MGT likes to exploit the pointless “Assange doesn’t criticize Ecuador” card.
[2015-08-25 22:30:15] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/TIME/status/636348096637726721 Hah.
[2015-08-25 23:07:44] <voidiss> Wow! I want to see one of those crayfish (before the US will start a crusade to slay them all. lol)
[2015-08-26 05:57:18] <LibertarianLibrarian> I doubt my govt would get away with attacking crayfish, environmentalists would go nuts. It’s only humans that are ‘fair game’ sadly.
[2015-08-26 05:59:19] <LibertarianLibrarian> You’ve got a stronger stomach than I do, Emmy, reading MGT’s stuff.
[2015-08-26 09:02:47] <Emmy B> 🙂 http://gizmodo.com/gizmodo-exclusive-read-julian-assanges-introduction-to-1726605781
[2015-08-26 11:37:11] <voidiss> This article – and the related talk at the CCCamp15 – are really interesting (and quite terrifying): https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/08/26/way-gchq-obliterated-guardians-laptops-revealed-intended/
[2015-08-26 13:25:49] <WikiLeaks> We’re somewhat horrified that Gizmodo has that first. The publisher must be on drugs. But we hear Newsweek is in two days.
[2015-08-26 13:38:45] <WikiLeaks> The talk is on Youtube and is worth watching.
[2015-08-26 13:42:56] <M> Link for the lazy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsC1puqhA4
[2015-08-26 13:45:59] <voidiss> Oh, I imagined it wasn’t your decision publishing on Gizmodo. Shame on the publisher.
[2015-08-26 15:22:43] <WISE Up Action> The CCR statement responding to FCO’s criticism of Ecuador https://ccrjustice.org/home/press-center/press-releases/after-uk-asylum-protest-wikileaks-attorneys-urge-uk-honor-viennahttp://shadowproof.com/2015/08/26/wikileaks-attorneys-oppose-diplomatic-retaliation-by-uk-against-ecuador/
[2015-08-26 23:21:04] <Emmy B> “The structured attempt at managing an extended cultural and economic system using communications is the hall- mark of empire.” and this explains why WikiLeaks is perceived to be such a threat, because the perceived high risk to its power.
[2015-08-26 23:21:18] <Emmy B> Essay is beautifully written.
[2015-08-26 23:37:51] <Emmy B> Would then the exclusion of WL publications from Academic study denote a kind of Medievalism in US Academia? a sign of decline, the centre of innovation may then be shifting elsewhere.
[2015-08-27 00:05:30] <Emmy B> ‘Every year, more than $1 billion is budgeted for “public diplomacy,” a circumlocutory term for outward-facing propaganda.’

[2015-08-27 02:07:12] <voidiss> Marian Radetzki has written an article about the Assange case: https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&hl=en&nv=1&prev=search&rurl=translate.google.co.uk&sl=sv&u=http://detgodasamhallet.com/2015/08/27/gastskribent-marian-radetzki-julian-assange-annu-en-skandal-for-svenskt-rattsvasende/&usg=ALkJrhhXiG34vTVEpJPMAIA6l4AlDRqMUQ
[2015-08-27 05:31:40] <voidiss> Also, I’ve found this PDF https://www.dfri.se/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/[email protected]_se to this http://www.regeringen.se/rattsdokument/statens-offentliga-utredningar/2015/03/sou-201531/
[2015-08-27 05:33:16] <WikiLeaks> Why is that interesting?
[2015-08-27 05:36:05] <voidiss> I thought that maybe knowing Sweden’s position on that issue may be useful.
[2015-08-27 05:38:15] <WikiLeaks> for FOIAs?
[2015-08-27 05:48:33] <LibertarianLibrarian> Good article by Radetzki, despite poor Google translation. Nice condemnation of prosecutors like Ny.
[2015-08-27 05:59:39] <voidiss> Oh, well… I was meaning in general; since data storage, how data can be used for law enforcement and the connection with privacy are important issues, knowing how Sweden hadles them may be useful in general, to have a more comprehensive view of Sweden itself. I wasn’t thinking about FOIAs, this PDF doesn’t seem to be about that, more about how Swedish regulations on data storage can be balanced with EU/ECHR laws.
[2015-08-27 07:46:40] <Emmy B> Thnx Greta, here is a translation of the article you shared by the Swedish Doctors for Human Rights 🙂 http://reports.swedhr.org/julian-assange-yet-another-scandal-for-the-swedish-justice/

[2015-08-27 12:39:17] <voidiss> Are they kidding? This is incredibly low also for Sweden. This is a mean mockery – giving a man the illusion of freedom for a day and then other jail he didn’t know anything about? Outrageous. There is no hope for Swedish justice system – not that I need further confirmations.

[2015-08-27 23:31:53] <voidiss> Which newspaper would be willing to run the risk of publishing unverified material such as those alleged “Embassy spy reports”? These documents are likely to be false, which journalist would ever take the responsibility to publish them knowing the low reputation of WLF?
[2015-08-27 23:31:56] <voidiss> (By the way, I hate when people do jokes like “I don’t think Assange will go anywhere in a hurry”. That’s inhuman.)
[2015-08-27 23:35:42] <Emmy B> Indeed!
[2015-08-28 00:36:06] <voidiss> Newsweek has arrived! http://www.newsweek.com/emb-midnight-827-assange-what-wikileaks-teaches-us-about-how-us-operates-366364
[2015-08-28 02:27:22] <Emmy B> Without any knowledge of French is difficult to assess if this is a positive article overall but certainly makes some positive remarks regarding JA and Asylum policy in France: http://www.bvoltaire.fr/nicolasbonnal/marine-a-raison-de-vouloir-proteger-assange-europeens,202021
[2015-08-28 02:28:29] <Emmy B> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/BellaMagnani/status/637192932290863104 oh just saw this
[2015-08-28 02:54:05] <voidiss> I think that being very nationalistic, Le Pen is also one of the strongest opposer of US control over France, so as a result she agrees with offering Assange asylum. But I think it’s positive too.

[2015-08-28 08:58:37] <M> Better article on Siggi http://icelandreview.com/news/2015/08/28/siggi-hacker-confesses-child-abuse
[2015-08-28 09:21:50] <M> @davidgcrouch reported on the docs showing that FBI requested Snowden’s extradition from Scandinavian countries. Includes quote from TO:
“This shows the Americans are very determined to get their hands on people that they think have damaged their security or a threat to security policy, and that includes of course Julian Assange.”
http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/28/edward-snowden-fbi-norway-extradite-julian-assange
[2015-08-28 10:35:28] <LibertarianLibrarian> That report is yet more support for why JA applied for and was given asylum by Ecuador. Sweden’s response even on Snowden made absolutely no sense.
[2015-08-28 12:01:24] <WikiLeaks> if people can tweet the newsweek excerpt (linked perhaps to interior sectiosn via archive.is or with image excerpts in the tweet) to the various diplomatic twitter accounts / diplomats / foreign affairs journalists / academics that’d be very helpful!
[2015-08-28 12:01:40] <WikiLeaks> Hopefully we can overcome the Gizmodo idiocy.
[2015-08-28 12:12:43] <noll> “in all likelihood a sociopath..” http://icelandreview.com/news/2015/08/28/siggi-hacker-confesses-child-abuse
[2015-08-28 12:13:58] <voidiss> Oh, sure, I’ll do! With diplomats, from which countries do you mean? US/UK or others?
[2015-08-28 12:14:32] <WikiLeaks> A variety. We noticed a turkish diplomat tweeted it yesterday
[2015-08-28 12:14:47] <WikiLeaks> And there’s a lot of these “twitter diplomacy” accounts
[2015-08-28 12:18:07] <voidiss> Okay, thank you! If someone needs it, I’ve found a list here: https://twitter.com/twiplomacy/lists/diplomats-missions/membershttps://twitter.com/Twiplomacy
[2015-08-28 12:23:20] <LibertarianLibrarian> oh, nice find, Greta, I was going to ask if anyone had one.
[2015-08-28 12:24:00] <voidiss> You’re welcome!
[2015-08-28 13:02:20] <M> I’d suggest finding a way to divide the list, or finding multiple lists. That way you avoid double-tweeting and also cover more ground.
[2015-08-28 13:04:42] <voidiss> Yes, probably divide them would be better. I’ve found also this list: https://twitter.com/UN/lists/diplomatic-missions-to-un/membershttps://twitter.com/DiplomacyEdu/lists/diplomats-on-twitter/membershttps://twitter.com/Twiplomacy/lists/diplomatic-academies/members
[2015-08-28 13:18:02] <voidiss> I start with “Diplomatic Academies” list, now.
[2015-08-28 13:20:26] <LibertarianLibrarian> I’ve been sending out WL’s foreign relations journals tweets to accounts I can find interested in the topic. But I’ll pick up one of the diplomat lists tonight. Still at work for a couple of hours.
[2015-08-28 14:13:09] <WikiLeaks> Does anyone have a times subscription? http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/magazine/article4537648.ece
[2015-08-28 14:20:14] <M> I know someone with one. Let me try contacting them.
[2015-08-28 17:34:43] <M> Hey Jenny, just a note – on your tweets to the diplomats the picture preview isn’t showing. Picture links starting with “pbs” won’t show previews; they need to start with “pic”. e.g. https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/637345356242665472/photo/1
[2015-08-28 17:35:52] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/637345356242665472 One way to retrieve that link from another tweet is through the use of the mobile site. So if you want the picture off this tweet: https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/637345356242665472https://m.twitter.com/wikileaks/status/637345356242665472
[2015-08-28 17:36:23] <M> And you can fetch the “pic” version of the image link that way. Hopefully that makes sense. 🙂
[2015-08-28 18:02:30] <WikiLeaks> FYI we have confirmed that James Ball is working on an article re-stating the Focus Ecuador article.
[2015-08-28 19:31:32] <M> Yes re article (previously mentioned that MGT seemed to be feeding it to people, including Ball).
[2015-08-28 19:49:22] <WISE Up Action> God, they are repulsive. Trough, trough, trough.
[2015-08-28 19:53:07] <noll> well, if you want competence re security – do it yourself, but that’s not a choice here. expect Ball et al. will have a field day.
[2015-08-28 19:54:06] <M> Ball is also at Buzzfeed now, which has even lower editorial standards than the Guardian, if any at all.
[2015-08-28 20:00:04] <WISE Up Action> Yep – and just enough veneer of issue to take it out of pure gossip (which I think they’ve done to death as far as the public are concerned tbh – there’s only so many times you can repeat ‘broom cupboard’ and all the other pathetic cliches). They should really get a life before they totally disappear up their own arses.
[2015-08-28 20:02:54] <WISE Up Action> I’ll try to pick up a physical copy of the Times tomorrow (today..), as well as you seeing if you can access online, M
[2015-08-28 20:05:39] <noll> worth saying that as w/ Germany, various ppl could use less blinkers re Ecu. embassy situ is unique/ v. high risk & Ecu nat. interests vs. those of Wls can only stretch so far – it’s complex & Ball isn’t exactly going to be penning a nuanced analysis.
[2015-08-28 23:21:51] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/BryanAppleyard/status/637508738715414528 Hopefully will have Times article in a few hours. Meanwhile, Appleyard approves of it, which isn’t a good sign (neither is the quote).
[2015-08-29 03:49:48] <WISE Up Action> It’s not nasty. Starts w him stressing the difference between what he’s been told to expect (a raving lunatic) and how he finds JA (perfectly rational). Which he obviously admires under the circumstances. Nonetheless “interviewing Assange is strange. Damn strange” I’ll bet!! Consider the life-choice disconnect.
The piece is kind of ‘languid’, flits about. Probably because he is unfamiliar with/uninterested in the real issues (as in geopolitics/justice/truth etc!).
But he doesn’t go on about the Swedish case at all; there’s much more about the US case, which he seems to take at face-value (despite that quote fr Appleyard). So it’s good in that it doesn’t belittle the threat to Assange even saying “he may be right about that” w ref to JA’s conviction that Ny’s delaying tactics are to serve the US timescale, enable them to build their case.
The worst thing is, that, apart from a ref to the “horrifying footage” of Collateral Murder, he has no regard for/understanding of the ground-breaking work of WikiLeaks, or JA’s role (so, what’s new?). It ends with
the terrible “he’s a hero to many in the land of protest for protest’s sake” after citing who he’s a villain to and why. And it really is like the bloke has landed on an alien planet and is trying to communicate the experience to the normals back home..
[2015-08-29 05:36:55] <voidiss> Thank you for the summary! If the article is like that, it’s really sad even if it’s not a smearing one. It shows one more time that there are too many people who don’t understand anything about WikiLeaks work, who think about Assange and other involved in this struggle as guys who fight just because they’re a sort of “we’re against everything just to be against” – which is so damn wrong -, or who don’t care about the important revelations at all. And all of this is so disappointing, even if it’s expectable, since many many people even refuse to inform themselves of get interested in these issues. And that’s why WL is so essential anyway.
[2015-08-29 05:37:00] <voidiss> And regarding Ball’s collaboration with MGT… I’m really curious to see if he will actually prove those documents are true.
[2015-08-29 06:05:00] <noll> highly likely they are genuine. re article, if spin placed over docs discounted, left w/ a completely unremarkable security service assessment detailing concerns any fool could list. the actual issue here is incompetence (every agency’s greatest enemy) – we’re not going to point out the obvious, or add to information already know.
[2015-08-29 07:17:28] <noll> re the assassination thing: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3215122/I-told-whistleblower-Edward-Snowden-escape-Russia-risk-kidnapped-killed-claims-Wikileaks-founder-Assange.html
[2015-08-29 07:28:08] <voidiss> Wait, so are you making another FOI request to UK regarding assassination threats against Assange?
[2015-08-29 07:30:31] <noll> yes, FOI already published re this matter was sent to Foreign Office, the HO request was sent 4 June.
[2015-08-29 07:30:51] <noll> HO = Home Office
[2015-08-29 07:35:28] <voidiss> Oh, okay, two FOIAs to two different govt bodies. Got it, thanks.
[2015-08-29 07:35:35] <voidiss> Well, UK likes Glomar responses so much…

[2015-08-29 07:45:48] <voidiss> Great, thank you. Here are some other articles about the interview and the assassination thing:
TeleSUR: http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Assange-Lives-in-Fear-of-Kidnapping-Assassination-20150829-0004.htmlhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/julian-assange-fears-hell-be-assassinated-if-he-leaves-the-ecuadorian-embassy-10478059.htmlhttp://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/aug/29/julian-assange-told-edward-snowdon-not-seek-asylum-in-latin-america?CMP=twt_gu
[2015-08-29 07:58:48] <M> IMO, first half of the interview is quite good. Second half is rather bad, gossipy.
[2015-08-29 08:56:55] <voidiss> I don’t like the tone of the article at all. The author manages to insert small ambiguous and unpleasant comments in many parts, and yes, it’s quite gossipy. But at least there are a few interesting points inside.

[2015-08-29 13:13:51] <voidiss> Thank you very much!
[2015-08-29 14:27:58] <M> Here is the “Count Assange” article: http://pastebin.com/fwimeTMr
[2015-08-29 14:28:50] <M> Unfortunately can’t do archive.is for the Times articles because the login name shows up at the top.
[2015-08-29 15:44:50] <M> With The Times publishing stuff more along that line, the sometimes-positivity of today’s magazine interview is quite impressive. The “Count Assange” article is pure speculation, but the author threw in bits taken from other articles in order to make it sound accurate. I love how the only source is “a diplomat familiar with the domestic set-up of Mr Assange”. Seeing as they don’t even specify WHERE the diplomat is from, my bet is that it was a UK diplomat.
[2015-08-29 15:53:03] <voidiss> Yes, maybe it was better not to read “Count Assange”, that’s an all-smearing article. The best thing is seeing how they belittle with no decency the high security concerns over surveillance and monitoring, both on Assange himself and on Ana Alban with the bugging device.
[2015-08-29 16:53:43] <noll> ‘Count Assange’ is reads like a UK FO fantasy that busily taps into Maduro’s 22% rating as though Correa’s 60%+ is not equally deserved, & the “diplomat familiar w/” has reseeded “stories” that are patent bullshit. it terms of an effective hit piece, it’s so amazingly poor, so completely obvious – have to ask, is that deliberate policy?
[2015-08-30 01:52:37] <M> Vivienne Westwood on JA and WL in latest interview: https://www.yahoo.com/style/vivienne-westwood-interview-kate-middleton-makeup-119273020777.html?nf=1
[2015-08-30 01:52:56] <M> Oops. Nvm, old interview. Never saw it though.
[2015-08-30 02:21:27] <voidiss> In an interview, William Blum says that “there’s a drone with Assange name on it” and that he is the enemy N°1 in US http://sputniknews.com/voiceofrussia/2013_01_28/There-is-a-drone-with-Assange-s-name-on-William-Blum/
[2015-08-30 02:24:29] <voidiss> All this is so terrible and frightening. They should’t even dare to try to do something to him, fuck.
[2015-08-30 02:37:42] <voidiss> Ops, that’s an old interview too, from 2013. But it’s in line with the assassination thing.
[2015-08-31 00:30:13] <Emmy B> The Times Interview did not mention ‘The WikiLeaks Files’
[2015-08-31 00:37:12] <voidiss> No, it does, but only in few lines and without analyzing or even citing why it is so important and valuable. Again, Whittell concentrates more on the “gossip” part like trying to guess who has written the anonymous chapters. Of course.
[2015-08-31 04:37:59] <noll> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/schwarz/status/638310645641945088 great response to a standard attack line.
[2015-08-31 06:17:08] <noll> guess indication that that report is genuine seen in censoring of focusequador’s entire site. an anti-Wls response.
[2015-08-31 06:20:46] <LibertarianLibrarian> Thanks M – I’ll try that next time re the photo, or put it up on my Tumblr or another website and link to it there.
[2015-08-31 06:21:22] <LibertarianLibrarian> Everything re the articles sounds about par for the course these days.
[2015-08-31 06:30:59] <voidiss> Wait, who has censored Focus Ecuador’s site?
[2015-08-31 06:41:33] <noll> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/focusecu/status/638093914105356288 https://twitter.com/focusecu/status/638093914105356288https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/state-censorship-copyright-spanish-firm-abuses-DMCA
[2015-08-31 06:51:23] <Emmy B> As the political struggle for power intensifies in Ecuador the big money will always find a way to push their message across to get back to power. Let’s not beat about the bush, using Assange for internal Ecuadorian politics can please one and only one master, the US and its local puppets.
[2015-08-31 06:52:45] <voidiss> Thank you, clear now. In
[2015-08-31 06:54:30] <voidiss> Thank you, clear now. It’s likely you’re right… That’s absolutely not a good thing when even Ecuador starts using JA in its political games.
[2015-08-31 06:54:54] <Emmy B> The agents of chaos are feasting in any country that lets powerful interests usurp and subvert social movements as a ladder for them to climb the steps of power.
[2015-08-31 06:58:21] <noll> Greta, it’s not Ecu ‘using JA’ – read the EFF article, it’s Ecu censoring of surveillance reporting, which is hardly w/o precedent.
[2015-08-31 06:58:55] <Emmy B> yep ‘Ecuador starts using JA’ is a simplification. Some power interests within Ecuador may wish to use JA for political games.
[2015-08-31 07:01:15] <voidiss> I’ve read it, I’m not referring to the DMCA notice against Focus Ecuador, I’m refferring to your initial point, that probably if Ares Rights have censored the site it’s because the documents are genuine. And that means they’re spying on him etc, so there may be an interest in using him for “political games” or something.
[2015-08-31 07:03:56] <Emmy B> …the world over… Greece, Italy, UK etc. of course on this particular occasion we are concerned foremost with JA’s safety. Correa’s gov has granted asylum.
[2015-08-31 07:05:07] <M> Comments from Swedish Prosecution Authority officer re today’s meeting between Ecuador and Sweden http://sputniknews.com/society/20150831/1026390585.html
[2015-08-31 07:07:40] <voidiss> Exactly. I’m just wondering how sincere the protection Ecuador’s offering to Julian is, now that we know they’re spying on him. I’ve always thought Ecuador was a solid, secure “ally” for Julian, I wouldn’t want to find out this isn’t true.
[2015-08-31 07:09:56] <noll> re ‘spying’ on JA. no security agency on *Earth is not going to do that – never mind JA, they’ll do it to entirety of own staff + all visitors – it’s an embassy! & the most spied upon, except perhaps for US in Moscow, Russia in DC.
[2015-08-31 07:14:36] <noll> of some concern is ‘management’ of JA. & all we can say is Larry David is better experienced on a screen at home.
[2015-08-31 07:14:57] <Emmy B> Thanks M, excellent!
[2015-08-31 07:20:39] <voidiss> What do you mean with “management”?
[2015-08-31 07:25:39] <Emmy B> My dear Greta, The Ecuadorian Embassy is responsible for JA’s safety, they have to manage, organise the security arrangements for his safety. They also have to organise the management of the Ambassadorial business at the Ecuadorian Embassy. And the safety of the Embassy’s staff. It is is for this reason that this space is granted by the Vienna Convention the privileges it has, this space continues and must continue to operate as an Embassy.
[2015-08-31 07:27:19] <voidiss> Okay, got it. I agree too. Sorry for this mess, I just needed to understand what you meant.
[2015-08-31 07:35:10] <Emmy B> I understand and it is good we discuss these matters. We all dream and share your wish for his freedom and try each and everyone of us to do something to help his cause, the WL cause. The Ecuadorian Government has to manage the situation the best way they can continuously for the last three years, under very difficult circumstances. The political leadership of Ecuador remains committed to protect his life, his Human Rights. Despite unprecedented pressures from US Ecuador has found it in their bones to stand up for him. Other Latin American countries support Ecuador’s decision. Other stronger nations like Italy, France, Germany UK, failed to act, even now after all we have learned from WL and Snowden, they still do not act. The world is revealed to us having a very ugly face. Still, it is Ecuador we have to thank for for every day that it passes.
[2015-08-31 07:36:45] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, it’s sometimes confusing, esp. when trying to weed out truth from propaganda. I’m not tremendously surprised that Correa has some bad apples around or that his govt, like any other, is engaged in some surveillance activities. It’s pervasive. I do suspect, however, that some of the attacks on Correa’s govt are due to US attempts to undermine him. But so far, he remains an incredibly popular and successful leader, for good reasons. And his govt seems committed to doing the right the thing by JA.
[2015-08-31 07:38:57] <Emmy B> yep 🙂
[2015-08-31 08:00:22] <noll> if you think ‘let’s monitor JA (what could possibly go wrong), &.. we’ve been hacked by the guys across the street!’ is woeful, it as *nothing compared to: https://www.emptywheel.net/2015/08/31/did-china-and-russia-really-need-our-help-targeting-spook-techies/
[2015-08-31 08:09:56] <M> Pretty decent backlash against ABC’s Tom Switzer for saying that WikiLeaks hacks its info on Qanda https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23qanda%20wikileaks&src=typd
[2015-08-31 10:39:59] <WikiLeaks> Ecuador is a state with good factions and bad. However some of the good things it has done are very good indeed, whereas its abuses are quite average.
[2015-08-31 10:51:41] <WikiLeaks> We suspect JV/Guardian have killed that article but remains a possibility that they’re biding their time.
[2015-08-31 10:59:53] <voidiss> It’s sad that some people use to blame JA for those average Ecuador’s abuses. Really pointless but of course very crafty for who has smearing aims.
[2015-08-31 10:59:56] <voidiss> I hope they have actually killed it.
[2015-08-31 11:02:08] <M> Snowden gets similar attacks re Russia. Greenwald made some good comments on it early on — as if there’s a perfect country on Earth to seek asylum in!
[2015-08-31 11:09:36] <WikiLeaks> On the quite average: there’s no allegation that ecuador has killed a journalist, that any are in prison for journalism, or even, with all the recent protests, that a single person was shot.
[2015-08-31 11:10:24] <WikiLeaks> Even in relation to Hackingteam, the allegation is that Ecuador had a license to spy on about 16 people concurrently.
[2015-08-31 11:11:55] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, exactly. Sadly, throwing dirt at other people is a very common method of trying to turn attention away from your own abuses.
[2015-08-31 11:12:21] <WikiLeaks> It hasn’t invaded anyone, bombed anyone, exported weapons to anyone. It’s people are the 3rd happiest in the world, according to Gallap.
[2015-08-31 11:16:16] <WikiLeaks> Its undoubtedly a democracy and its economy has been growing at double the european average for almost a decade.
[2015-08-31 11:16:26] <LibertarianLibrarian> Wow, a whole 16 people! How horrible. *sigh* Meanwhile the govts of the people throwing most of accusations are spying on pretty much the whole world, esp my own.
[2015-08-31 11:19:07] <WikiLeaks> Oil makes up around 15% of the economy, but around 50% of tax revenues so the recent oil collapse has been difficult for the government, which has had to introduce new taxes as a result.
[2015-08-31 11:20:32] <LibertarianLibrarian> Of course, no one likes new taxes. So you get some protests, esp. when the wealthiest sector is hit in their pockets.
[2015-08-31 11:20:56] <voidiss> Thanks for all this information. Correa’s a representative of a lefties government, so of course it’s very convenient for many people – especially US puppets – make Ecuador seem as a soft of oppressive regime, even when it is not, as the information you tell are showing. It has, of course, many difects and “average abuses” to fix, but not as bas as some try to say – and especially, not as bad as many other countries that instead are considered “perfect libertarian democracies”, i.e. US. And obviously Assange is not responsible for politicians’ decision when it comes to “average abuses”.
[2015-08-31 11:22:52] <LibertarianLibrarian> I don’t think anyone in their right mind would think of the US as a ‘perfect libertarian democracy’, esp. not those of us who actually are libertarians. 🙁
[2015-08-31 11:23:55] <voidiss> Oh, well, I’m not referring to informed people! I’m referring also to the image US are trying to show.
[2015-08-31 11:26:02] <LibertarianLibrarian> I suspect that image is pretty much a total fail at this point. I don’t know a single person who is actually happy with our government, even if we totally disagree on what the government should be doing. But the level of disgust with Washington is extraordinary and I get the sense much of the UK feels similarly.
[2015-08-31 11:26:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> The problem is turning that disgust into action.
[2015-08-31 11:26:52] <WikiLeaks> Ecuador has been very good at firing cops. It has fired thousands.
[2015-08-31 11:27:20] <LibertarianLibrarian> Now that’s something a lot of nations could learn from Ecuador.
[2015-08-31 11:29:02] <LibertarianLibrarian> Actually, I think the utter failure of the justice system in the US may – finally – be the thing that sets off real, mass, public response.
[2015-08-31 11:31:24] <LibertarianLibrarian> Bottom-line, we all know Ecuador isn’t perfect, but it has provided some real examples of good, solid leadership and integrity. Goodness knows those are few and far between in today’s world, so well worth celebrating, even despite some imperfections.
[2015-08-31 11:32:11] <Emmy B> I am impressed with the courage and consistency of a small nation finally exercising their sovereignty to improve the welfare of their people, a country that is very poor with a colonial and difficult political past.
[2015-08-31 11:34:51] <Emmy B> My own country, so much better off, but equally small, is instead pre-occupied in de-frauding the state and when caught read handed pass the buck to infinity and beyond, pretending to be the peacock admiring its own feathers.
[2015-08-31 11:35:45] <voidiss> @wikileaks, may I suggest you share publicly this information about Ecuador? This would help, so who say “WL never talks about Ecuador” should have to shut up, and moreover awareness would increase. But it’s just my opinion…
[2015-08-31 11:35:50] <voidiss> Anyway, about the US, here in Italy – especially among uninformed and indifferent young people – the feeling of “trust” for US seems still pretty high. I mean, many knows about the black stains of that govt, but despite this they still claim and believe US are a true democracy, one of the best compared to many bad evil ugly African/Asian countries. And it’s shocking how few actually knows the extent of US surveillance despite the Snowden revelations (almost not covered here apart from some journalists).
[2015-08-31 11:36:14] <Emmy B> even the first glimpse of hope in last January’s election has not survived past 7 months.
[2015-08-31 11:36:59] <voidiss> And yes, I agree with Emmy, at least Ecuador had courage to stand up and also to improve itself. Instead – despite Troika plans were absurd – also Greece had its faults.
[2015-08-31 11:37:10] <Emmy B> WL is not required to defend Ecuadorian politics Greta.
[2015-08-31 11:38:48] <voidiss> No, of course not! But I think it would be helpful for WL itself, to stop the old criticism “not talking about Ecuador”… But maybe you’re right, it’s not the case.
[2015-08-31 11:39:27] <LibertarianLibrarian> It might not be bad for ‘us’ to have some facts on Ecuador saved somewhere, though, when someone throws that kind of stuff at us.
[2015-08-31 11:39:38] <LibertarianLibrarian> I’ve had it happen.
[2015-08-31 11:43:26] <Emmy B> Well it is crystal clear from what MGT tweets that this is exactly the objective of the ones who spit out misinformation, to entangle WL into Ecuadorian internal politics to damage Correa and jeopardise JA’s asylum.
[2015-08-31 11:43:26] <LibertarianLibrarian> Greta, there are a lot of great things about the US. Our Consitution and Bill of Rights, no matter how abused in present practice, stands for things I believe deeply in and would/will fight for. Also, in general, the vast majority of people there, as everywhere, are good people who simply want to live in peace. As the saying goes, power corrupts and that’s a problem everywhere, but esp. when a govt grows as big as the USG.
[2015-08-31 11:44:57] <Emmy B> See how the misinformation about Snowden’s escape twists WL’s involvement to stir discord among LatAme countries with JA at epicentre.
[2015-08-31 11:46:29] <Emmy B> We stick to facts, the truth, supporting WL as each one of us sees fit and able to do so, there is no book with instructions 🙂
[2015-08-31 11:46:45] <WikiLeaks> Yes. There’s mischief there to try and take the heat off US/Europe and make problems for JA in Latam.
[2015-08-31 11:47:01] <LibertarianLibrarian> So far, the LatAm countries have done a surprisingly good job of avoiding that kind of discord given the amount of pressure on them.
[2015-08-31 11:48:14] <LibertarianLibrarian> But there’s no question the pressure is increasing as they continue to try to shore up their independence.
[2015-08-31 11:49:18] <Emmy B> Good point Jenny, They were not born yesterday, these politicians know how the system works, political naivety is rare among them but the flow of money can create a wave of misinformation.

[2015-08-31 20:16:39] <noll> Christmas eve 4.21 pm, “Madame Secretary, first of all, Merry Christmas. I trust you, the President and Chelsea will have a special holiday.” the rest is redacted. what was the present?
[2015-08-31 21:05:22] <WikiLeaks> Quite.
[2015-08-31 21:09:52] <noll> https://twitter.com/hazelpress/status/638563935726252033
[2015-08-31 21:37:29] <voidiss> Look the “H: WIKILEAKS. SID” one. That’s almost ridiculous. They were trying to push the “docs show US govt is telling the truth” line. That’s beyond despair, they’re pathetic. https://foia.state.gov/Search/Results.aspx?collection=Clinton_Email_august_Release
[2015-09-01 02:11:10] <noll> from other side it’s 20’s crowd that are Wls puppet-masters: “In commentary, Granma’s Manuel E. Yepe, a Cuban lawyer, economist, journalist and former Cuban ambassador to Romania, suggests that Wikileaks “yielded to pressure from the USG and the media in managing how and when information was released, and insinuates that right
wing elements in the U.S. are behind the disclosure of the documents.” https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_August_Web/IPS-0111/DOC_0C05776619/C05776619.pdf
[2015-09-01 02:26:34] <noll> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/kravietz2/status/638632133637095424 apparently Guardian is a better source re Wls actions than Wls.
[2015-09-01 02:48:30] <voidiss> LOL, and where does that story of WL “yielding to pressure” come from? It’s funny, since what USG said is “cease publication, return material, destroy already published docs” and WL did the exact opposite. And about that letter, I particularly like the fear-mongering that bring them to cite even… pandemic diseases.
[2015-09-01 02:55:34] <WikiLeaks> Ball http://www.buzzfeed.com/jamesball/mr-white-and-mr-blue
[2015-09-01 02:59:56] <voidiss> And in Sweden support for NATO membership grows: http://www.thelocal.se/20150901/swedish-party-in-u-turn-on-nato-membership
[2015-09-01 03:08:26] <noll> amazing that w/ all of the interesting issues the report highlights all Ball can come up w/ is a whatever gossip piece that even resorts to old news padding. it’s fucking pathetic.
[2015-09-01 03:10:53] <WikiLeaks> Yes. And the wankers now congratuating him on the ‘scoop’, which is two weeks old, third hand and extremely dubious.
[2015-09-01 03:18:18] <voidiss> Because obviously a quarrel between Assange and a security guard is a very important information, isn’t it? No — unless you want to depict Assange as an “out of control” guy, which perfectly fits Ball’s aim. Crappy. And he even dares to claim he’s not establishment…
[2015-09-01 03:38:16] <noll> another issue of interest: focusequador = ecuadorreview = Fundamedios = Cesar Recaurte = USAID: https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/ecuadoran-president-accuses-media-observation-group-receiving-us-funding
[2015-09-01 03:59:57] <M> It’s amusing how more people are picking up the “fancy dress escape plan” from the article than anything else. Also, the forced “troubled 3 years” headline, for two alleged events over 2.5 years ago.
[2015-09-01 04:06:35] <WikiLeaks> There may be opportunities in the article, re the surveillance
[2015-09-01 04:07:46] <noll> opportunities for?
[2015-09-01 04:08:28] <WikiLeaks> Educate people about the severity of the siege.
[2015-09-01 04:09:36] <WikiLeaks> It’s quite amazing how invariably JA’s successful application for political asylum is turned into “seeking asylum” and the admitted US case is turned into “JA claims of possible US prosecution”.
[2015-09-01 04:10:29] <voidiss> And note the use of the word “flight”.
[2015-09-01 04:15:13] <voidiss> And I find quite damaging that the strategies to get JA out are being reported (even if they had no continuation), since now the MET can prepare a “defence”.
[2015-09-01 04:15:18] <voidiss> By the way, about the opportunities, do you mean using this article to highlight the severity, or using Focus Ecuador’s one?
[2015-09-01 04:18:04] <WikiLeaks> “The room visible in the photos from the secret Ecuadorian report clearly matches the one in an August 2013 video released by Assange as part of his bid to run for the Australian senate (Assange’s embassy room is visible in the video between 3:42 and 4:16).”
[2015-09-01 04:18:25] <WikiLeaks> Actually, it is clearly a completely different room.
[2015-09-01 04:19:29] <WikiLeaks> They’re not strategies. These are just things already mentioned in the press. The idea of Ecuador flying in a rescue helicopter is completely absurd.
[2015-09-01 04:20:43] <WikiLeaks> We just mean if there is pickup. We need to see what is picked up.
[2015-09-01 04:21:00] <WikiLeaks> There’s about 6 angles in the article.
[2015-09-01 04:23:43] <voidiss> Wha to do you mean with 6 angles?
[2015-09-01 04:24:21] <WikiLeaks> Different things the media may pick up on.
[2015-09-01 04:27:36] <M> First media pick up. Dutch article focuses on surveillance, adverse affects to JA. http://www.nu.nl/algemeen/4117195/ambassade-ecuador-volgt-bewegingen-van-assange-nauwkeurig.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter
[2015-09-01 04:38:45] <noll> now that report is available (& focusecuador didn’t post it, so how did WLF get hold of it? http://www.wikileaks-forum.com/senain-report/665/
[2015-09-01 04:42:40] <WikiLeaks> That looks like an earlier report that was posted as a pdf. Cryptome has a copy.
[2015-09-01 04:52:55] <noll> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/BellaMagnani/status/638680087966171136 hilarious. https://twitter.com/BellaMagnani/status/638680087966171136https://archive.is/eWZ6z#selection-2733.0-2733.177

[2015-09-01 07:02:26] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/anneapplebaum/status/638705555637424128 Look who’s picked up on 20committee’s bs
[2015-09-01 07:09:53] <voidiss> Oh, WLF has been suspended. But I don’t know why.
[2015-09-01 07:10:29] <LibertarianLibrarian> To me, Ball may have done the opposite of what he wanted – that article clearly shows the intense pressure and difficulty JA has suffered. Of course, the people around him are concerned about his physical and mental health – that’s totally normal. He’s been imprisoned in a small place for years without access to sunshine and knowing his life is in danger, plus the incredible surveillance and number of police outside. Name one person who wouldn’t get a bit stir crazy or have nightmares. To me, this makes JA more sympathetic, not less. It may backfire on them.
[2015-09-01 07:12:20] <LibertarianLibrarian> Can’t complain about WLF being suspended for whatever reason. 🙂
[2015-09-01 07:40:45] <M> Interesting that both Telegraph and Yahoo used ‘fancy dress’ as the headline for covering Ball’s piece. https://uk.news.yahoo.com/diplomats-suggested-julian-assange-wear-142418725.html#tRZSvNP
[2015-09-01 08:05:44] <voidiss> And here is The Independent: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/julian-assange-leaked-documents-reveal-ecuadorian-embassys-disguise-escape-plan-10481420.html

[2015-09-01 09:40:07] <LibertarianLibrarian> Hardly surprising, it’s all tabloid – style reporting these days, sensationalism rules.
[2015-09-01 09:49:26] <M> RT covered the story on a decent fashion. http://www.rt.com/uk/314014-assange-ecuadorian-embassy-escape/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter
[2015-09-01 09:51:24] <voidiss> Apart from the ‘has escaped extradition order”. Here is Sputnik version, which I still find too focused on the escape plans: http://sputniknews.com/europe/20150901/1026453423/Assange-WikiLeaks-embassy-escape.html#ixzz3kVKXNVLy

[2015-09-02 04:02:46] <Bean> ps welcome greta 🙂
[2015-09-02 04:10:56] <WikiLeaks> Hi Bean. Timeline looks great. Suggest just one addition, Sweden/US in talks about JA’s onwards extradition, Dec 2010
[2015-09-02 04:11:12] <WikiLeaks> i.e that appeared in the independent
[2015-09-02 04:14:45] <Bean> right-o – yep good one to add, ta – what about anything for august 2015?
[2015-09-02 04:19:44] <WikiLeaks> Keep it brief. Something like Swedish prosecution drops three our of four claims due to time limit. O
[2015-09-02 04:22:09] <Bean> ok will do – thx
[2015-09-02 04:22:22] <WikiLeaks> Would also add google warrants and federal court confirms pending prosecution
[2015-09-02 04:30:34] <Bean> will find dates for those or add them to the red bar running throughout the timeline… re the sw/us talks re onward extradition point: it’s actually already included in the dec 7, 2010 point: “US in preemptive talks with Sweden to transfer Assange to US.”

[2015-09-02 09:25:24] <WikiLeaks> Only global dictatorship can stop climate change.
[2015-09-02 09:25:58] <WikiLeaks> So things are looking up!
[2015-09-02 09:27:36] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/newsinvideos/status/639105455675998208 OK, this graphic that RT made is pretty great.
[2015-09-02 09:32:02] <WikiLeaks> Luise Mensch is a fruit loop. Might be worth pushing her so it becomes obvious to all.
[2015-09-02 09:32:16] <WikiLeaks> (if it isn’t already)
[2015-09-02 09:33:10] <M> Did you catch this re Mensch a couple weeks ago? Hilarious. http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/22/louise-menschs-bid-to-smear-jeremy-corbyn-backfires
[2015-09-02 09:43:38] <voidiss> Very very interesting article, thank you Hazelpress! Anyway, I completely agree on the “astonishing, terrifying”. It’s alarming that those war game was done on hypothesis for 2015 – hypothesis that actually are happening now. And I find quite scaring (though really telling) that the only way the Five Eyes are finding to deal with climate change is extending the scope of their control over citizens, exercizing more surveillance, both with the May 2013 “emergency authority” and all the different laws to “outlaw/limit protests”. Instead, on the political side, they are doing pretty well, no important political agreement/solutions have been reached (quite the opposite, the latest Artic drilling issue shows). They think the solution to everything is more control — or maybe it’s convenient for them to think so.
[2015-09-02 09:44:13] <voidiss> At the CCCamp there was a talk, “Resisting surveillance”; the main subject of the talk is different from climate change, but a clip made by one of the speaker is linked to this: it’s about a police officer, Mark Kennedy, who infiltrated a environmental activists group and led to the arrest of them all before a planned peaceful action against a coal power plant: https://youtu.be/6eOmj-EUXfU?t=305
[2015-09-02 09:49:42] <WikiLeaks> The Kennedy talk is excellent
[2015-09-02 09:51:42] <voidiss> Yes, I agree! Not just for the “criminalize enviromental activists” issue, but for the whole subject of physical surveillance in general. It shows the vast scope of non-digital espionage.
[2015-09-02 09:56:35] <Bean> [Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/639119741551005699/639119741576183808/jy6B0Cty.png hey all – do you reckon the timeline is good to go?
[2015-09-02 11:37:16] <WikiLeaks> “intervenes” is probably better than “interfers”
[2015-09-02 11:42:10] <voidiss> Maybe you can add 10 August 2010, when the US called on allies to open criminal investigations into Assange… But anyway I love it! <3
[2015-09-02 11:43:20] <WikiLeaks> “google email” could be stronger and start with “US WikiLeaks warrants servered on Google reveal…”
[2015-09-02 11:45:53] <WikiLeaks> You could add “Swedish intelligence seize 3 Assange laptops as he leaves country” for sep 27, 2010
[2015-09-02 11:46:35] <WikiLeaks> There’s the FBI raid in UK on manning’s mother’s house in july, 2010
[2015-09-02 11:47:12] <WikiLeaks> And the private jet with 6 FBI and 2 prosecutors ilicitly landing in Iceland then being kicked out for operating illegally
[2015-09-02 11:47:36] <WikiLeaks> Ditto FBI in denmark
[2015-09-02 11:48:28] <WikiLeaks> there”s the 120 man pengaon “wikileaks war room” staffed with DIA+FBI
[2015-09-02 11:48:44] <WikiLeaks> the bug found in the embassy
[2015-09-02 11:49:17] <WikiLeaks> a whole raft of other stuff that could be used for the US section

[2015-09-02 11:50:57] <voidiss> There’s also the media-coordinated smearing campaign #prataomdet from 2010.
[2015-09-02 11:51:00] <WikiLeaks> snowden rescue could be there
[2015-09-02 11:51:34] <WikiLeaks> or the UK’s cancellation of its UK-Ecuador legal committee as a result
[2015-09-02 11:53:37] <noll> “Taylor Swift should probably seek asylum in the nearest Ecuadorian embassy before she is extradited!” http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/sep/02/taylor-swift-wildest-dreams-video-colonial-african-fantasy#comment-58677431
[2015-09-02 12:02:11] <noll> thanks Greta, & for the link, will watch video this evening.
[2015-09-02 12:07:36] <WikiLeaks> Swift is borning.
[2015-09-02 12:08:14] <WikiLeaks> She uses her celibrity to push inane class ridden sterotypes.
[2015-09-02 12:09:00] <WikiLeaks> 50 shades of grey loving it up in a country mansion, etc.
[2015-09-02 12:09:53] <WikiLeaks> Even gansters with ho’s and fast cars is more original.
[2015-09-02 12:54:17] <WISE Up Action> Getting ‘account suspended’ when trying links posted by M and G for WLF ‘temp a/c’.
[2015-09-02 13:21:36] <voidiss> That her audience are “children” makes more problematic that she’s pushing stereotypes.
[2015-09-02 13:33:56] <LibertarianLibrarian> Bean – the only thing I noticed about the timeline is that I found it slightly difficult to look up and then down to find things in order by time. I know it’s hard to keep it from being very crowded. Maybe make the lines to the content bubbles stronger/larger?
[2015-09-02 13:37:24] <LibertarianLibrarian> Swift isn’t too bad. Pop music these days is basically all image and most of that comes from the corps and managers.
[2015-09-02 13:39:14] <Emmy B> @ WiseUp Chris reported that account too and it got suspended. These are not permanent suspensions.

[2015-09-02 14:35:56] <LibertarianLibrarian> I love @JuiceRapNews!
[2015-09-02 14:36:25] <LibertarianLibrarian> The NYT is going down the same slide as the Guardian, sadly.
[2015-09-02 14:52:00] <Bean> thanks all for the timeline suggestions… original idea was to show ongoing activity of US investigation vs lack of activity from the swedish prosecution… so will incorporate some more of those US actions… and good point jenny – yes has been a bit tricky to fit it all in legibly as want it to be an image that can be easily shared (something that can fit on a web page/blog/article) – bolder lines will probably help… will have a further look at it all tomorrow… thx
[2015-09-02 15:35:28] <noll> re report & media’s either sympathetic or sensationalist take on life w/i embassy, worth mentioning ‘Biosphere 2’ project & Jane Poynter’s honest documenting of the challenges: http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Human-Experiment-Minutes-Biosphere/dp/156025775Xhttp://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6929010
[2015-09-02 17:25:29] <M> I’ve been out to Biosphere 2 – it is quite extraordinary.
[2015-09-02 19:15:29] <noll> M, would do just about anything to see that place, followed by: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle%27s_Lagoon
[2015-09-02 19:16:12] <noll> not great quality: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QesWw3Zz0Ms
[2015-09-02 20:46:14] <noll> gd. interview w/ Emma Thompson re CC/ refu crisis 20.45: http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0699wls/newsnight-02092015
[2015-09-03 00:13:04] <voidiss> Wow! Never heard of ‘Biosphere 2’, it’s an amazing project, really fascinating from a scientific point of view to see how they manage to keep alive six different biomes in a restricted place like that. Science is so interesting.
[2015-09-03 00:13:17] <voidiss> And the experiment is quite representative… “sealed into a closed environment”. It’s so sad if compared with the Embassy, that crew was there voluntarily, not detained inside. It’s so bad. I’ll read the book, anyway.
[2015-09-03 05:29:21] <noll> FOI sophistry by Cecilia Riddselius: https://hazelpress.wordpress.com/2015/09/03/120/
[2015-09-03 06:38:34] <Emmy B> Despite jubilations for the temporary suspension of FWLF twitter account the truth is MGT managed to create with James Ball’s assistance a story that went viral in UK press. I am concerned that he could therefore persuade James Ball to write about the libellous claims regarding Chris and her daughter. If advance knowledge ever exist over such article please notify me or Chris directly as she will seek an injunction. Thank you 🙂
[2015-09-03 07:03:17] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, we’ll have to keep an eye on Ball. Hate to follow the jerk but worth it if we can help Chris and her daughter. They’ve been through far too much already.
[2015-09-03 07:07:11] <LibertarianLibrarian> The Biosphere is really neat. I toured it once, several years ago, with my father. It was fascinating. Tucson’s well worth a visit, not just for the Biosphere. The Desert Museum is amazing and you can go up into the Canyons and hike – unbelievably gorgeous.
[2015-09-03 07:22:18] <M> Definitely keep on eye on MGT/Ball, but I think this was just a fluke. It wasn’t like MGT was able to spread one of his ridiculous claims alone; he just passed on something that hadn’t caught the attention of western press yet.
[2015-09-03 07:31:06] <M> Sana Saleem (of @couragefound etc) tweeted out a few things against the Ball article. https://twitter.com/sanasaleem
[2015-09-03 07:45:05] <voidiss> Regarding the Riddselius answer to FOI… It’s incredible that after all the mess in the media and Ecuador’s statement in response, she’s still talking about ‘granting asylum’ when instead it is simply ‘recognizing asylum’: “MoJ, according to the Constitution, cannot make any promises or enter an Agreement granting any persons asylum status on beforehand”. Willing nonsense.
[2015-09-03 08:25:49] <Bean> [Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/639459289044795396/639459289078329344/1KZLfZqj.png here’s the latest on the timeline – have added a couple more suggested points to add some depth to the US investigation, but i think any more (such as delving into the icelandic story, and diverting somewhat from the theme with snowden stuff) will just make it all a bit overwhelming. people more likely to read if there aren’t too many points – and then they’ll at least get the salient facts – and the central point re ongoing US investigation whilst swedish prosecutor twiddles her thumbs… feel free to make any further suggestions though of course!
[2015-09-03 08:27:31] <Bean> maybe a subtitle would be good too? something like ‘sweden stalls while US investigates’?
[2015-09-03 09:09:48] <noll> M, Saleem isn’t accurate w/ re to practises during that period. also, it is inconceivable that such incidents (the soup opera stuff) wouldn’t occur, given fact JA is human & not a robot (speaking of which we need to fix a door – furious mother + 10 yr old twins that seem to think they’re living in South LA etc). we don’t know if report is genuine, but if it isn’t, we’d expect actual report would contain v. similar content.
[2015-09-03 09:13:04] <noll> Greta, imagine Riddselius’ reply taking place during a conversation – would seem like absurdist theatre.
[2015-09-03 09:53:12] <noll> in terms of response – a better line to take would be “leaked report reveals extent of Swe/ UK human rights abuses – will it be submitted to ECtHR?” etc.
[2015-09-03 10:32:59] <voidiss> Absurdist’s an euphemism! How can she believe to be credible pushing this already-discredited lie? There was an Ecuador statement in response and she admitted she ‘misunderstood EC’s request’! And yet here she is, again with ‘granting asylum’. She takes advantage b/cos it’s just a FOI and so she dares to answer what she wants, even if when she speaks to press she says ‘Sweden agreed to everything Ecuador requested’.
[2015-09-03 10:33:49] <voidiss> Wait, which leaked report are you talking about?
[2015-09-03 10:36:58] <voidiss> Bean, I think it look really good! I agree with you, better not to fill it too much. Maybe for the Snowden stuff etc there will be another timeline… I think the subtitle it’s a good idea, it could help to get the point immediately.
[2015-09-03 10:43:13] <M> Remember though, after Ecuador’s statement that they did not demand Sweden give JA asylum, Riddselius said, “That’s how we understand it.”
[2015-09-03 10:43:54] <M> When was the misunderstood statement? I just remember the one where she refused to admit they were wrong. http://www.aftonbladet.se/senastenytt/ttnyheter/inrikes/article21236668.ab
[2015-09-03 11:10:14] <noll> Greta, the various reports given to Focusequador. they clearly state that JA has been put at “psychological risk” & has shown symptoms of “emotional imbalance” – there is also the issue of “vision problems”, all of which is caused by Ny/ Swe’s (w/ UK’s consent) policy of indefinite detention w/o charge.
[2015-09-03 11:16:24] <voidiss> Sorry, M, I remembered the quote wrong, the right one is what you cited. I have interpreted that “that’s how we understood it” as an admission of misunderstanding, not as a refusal to say they were wrong. Maybe it’s just too ambiguous.
[2015-09-03 11:16:33] <voidiss> Oh, yes, I agree with you. It should be a good way to deal with it, especially with the UN Working Group on Abritrary Detention that is going to give it’s verdict.
[2015-09-03 11:16:52] <voidiss> *would
[2015-09-03 11:23:42] <noll> yes, it’s: “Something that government can not do under Swedish law” “- That’s how we understand it, says Cecilia Riddselius at the Justice Department” Riddselius reply basically states: international law applies, international doesn’t apply, come to Swe JA! where international law applies!
[2015-09-03 11:24:21] <noll> * international law doesn’t apply
[2015-09-03 12:41:54] <M> Leaked report has come full circle and is now being reported in Ecuadorian Press. http://www.elcomercio.com/actualidad/plan-escape-assange-embajada-ecuatoriana.html
[2015-09-03 13:09:23] <voidiss> But it seems that articles are still concentrating more on the escape plans than on the heaviness of surveillance.
[2015-09-03 13:12:22] <noll> worth noting JB article & MGT Google Drive does not contain the ‘Operativo Hotel’ docu cited in the Focusequador article: https://archive.is/tkPBd#selection-753.0-759.332https://archive.is/eWZ6zhttps://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B5RTNnfyNdgwfkVDZU1oVk1PNGFLVldPcmZDbUtXenh5T000SlFvUi1QT1UwcW4wa28zWFk&usp=sharing&tid=0B5RTNnfyNdgwfkozTTVkNlY2RThZLVZYZ1BqUHVxQ2V5WkN3RU4zaUR1MXo2YVdidFhoNWM
[2015-09-03 13:38:35] <noll> before 18 August article Villavicencio only mentioned JA 11 times. so, he’s not that interested. where did docs come from? whether genuine or semi-genuine, where was material obtained & by whom? huge story if agencies surveilling embassy have breached Ecu security service & passed material onto likes of Villavicencio. https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%40fevillavicencio%20Assange&src=typd

[2015-09-03 16:54:57] <noll> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/DaveBlacklist/status/639381443693707264
[2015-09-03 17:00:55] <noll> M, it depends how they run the cabinet, & whether allow party conferences to guide or make policy. unlike all recent PMs, JC intends to be democratic. expect critical opposition cabinet positions, such as HO, will be filled by ppl JC can rely on, although events often change that.
[2015-09-03 18:12:08] <M> That’s all PM stuff though, right? And that election isn’t until 2020. Would he have any considerable powers just as party leader?
[2015-09-03 18:37:54] <noll> he can make it a live issue in terms of parliamentary committees (esp. (http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/home-affairs-committee/membership/http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/human-rights-committee/role/http://www.scania.com/media/pressreleases/N07013EN.aspx
[2015-09-03 18:48:28] <noll> committee questions could open up the whole thing, b/c ministers can’t glomar them.

[2015-09-05 12:27:41] <M> Important Cool might be interested in doing an investigative piece on Villavicencio, since they’ve covered false reporting about Ecuador quite a bit in the past.
[2015-09-05 14:57:33] <Emmy B> TPP – The Press Project form Greece have launched this petition : http://www.thepressproject.gr/details_en.php?aid=81035
[2015-09-05 14:58:34] <Emmy B> Today in Greek they publish http://www.thepressproject.gr/article/81051/APOKALUPsI-Otan-i-EE-buthize-ta-ploia-ton-prosfugon
[2015-09-05 14:59:58] <Emmy B> ‘When EU was sinking the migrants’ boats’ linking to WikiLeaks https://wikileaks.org/eu-military-refugees/press.html
[2015-09-05 15:02:08] <Emmy B> in support of their efforts to change EU policy regarding migrants/refugees from the militaristic approach to a humane solution.
[2015-09-05 15:04:03] <Emmy B> they also link to an earlier Guardian article http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/18/eu-mediterranean-naval-mission-migrant-crisis-people-smugglers-libya
[2015-09-05 15:09:12] <Emmy B> Interestingly, although TPP subtitles the article “The Press Project in collaboration with WikiLeaks…” and atributes extensively to WL by referral to the docs released, they do not directly link to the http://wikileaks.org
[2015-09-05 15:11:26] <Emmy B> I don’t recall if WL had a greek partner for this release. Being one of the two countries of entry for EU (Italy being the other) there is obviously a lot of interest on the topic.
[2015-09-05 15:17:13] <Emmy B> The concluding paragraph says “The European Council approved the military assistance against Assad in Syria in recent years and helped to equip the rebels (later named ISIS who stained with the region with blood) once again respond with military interventions to one of the most complex immigration problems.
The ThePressProject already took the initiative of collecting signatures for the reversal of the European Commission policy. Instead of spending millions of euros on the bombing of civilian infrastructure and the dealing with the “public relations management” of the problem we propose the creation of humanitarian structures for documents (visas) at the nodes/centres of movement of refugees in order not to see more drowned children washed up on the Mediterranean seas.”
[2015-09-05 15:19:25] <Emmy B> I mention this article here because it is the first time I see a WL document being published and promoted by a Greek reputable site in support of a (in effect) political campaigning. It remains to be seen if any political party picks up the proposal. 🙂
[2015-09-05 16:47:40] <M> JV piece may have been abandoned, but Guardian just published a big hit piece on Assange/Ecuador by Nick Cohen. It’s seriously pathetic. https://archive.is/uQMyC
[2015-09-05 16:52:28] <Emmy B> (his hyperlinking to New stateman’s DAG article not working *grin*)
[2015-09-05 16:54:46] <Emmy B> If Corbyn is ever elected, the Guardian might include Britain on their list of authoritarian countries. How bizarre!
[2015-09-05 17:08:26] <Emmy B> *like*
[2015-09-06 05:55:15] <voidiss> Thank you, Emmy, for the info about TPP! I get the impression that WL is rather popular in Greece, first with Varoufakis and the TTIP prize, than with this petition linking to documents. It’s great!
[2015-09-06 05:56:31] <voidiss> And regarding the Guardian article… I will never stop being disgusted by all these smearing attemps, even if they’re so expectable now. It’s horrible. Obviously there’s the link to Ball article. And obviously Cohen cites the Buzzfeed documents but he “looks beyond” the difficult situation of Assange as if it’s of no importance.
[2015-09-07 05:06:54] <noll> interesting, Nick Cohen in 2001, ‘Bread not Bombs: By doing little to avert a famine in Afghanistan, the West is sowing the seeds for more Islamic hatred’ https://archive.is/juqZ7#selection-1885.1-1885.37https://archive.is/DXZic#selection-1867.1-1867.39https://archive.is/LFzmm#selection-427.4-427.33https://archive.is/4Twog#selection-1653.1-1653.56
[2015-09-07 05:11:25] <WikiLeaks> Cohen follows a well warn trajectory. Get left, get some power, get right, get more power.
[2015-09-07 05:12:56] <WikiLeaks> He’s a lesser Hitchens, of whom, he is of course, a fan.

[2015-09-07 07:28:20] <voidiss> Sorry, what is TL?
[2015-09-07 07:28:39] <noll> amusing if Ecu asked for MGT’s extradition on espionage charges & he sought asylum in US embassy.
[2015-09-07 07:28:50] <noll> TL = Twitter line
[2015-09-07 07:31:51] <noll> why stop there when could repurpose US propagandists typical line into ‘MGT is USAID spy’.
[2015-09-07 07:34:56] <voidiss> Thanks!
[2015-09-07 07:35:31] <voidiss> Anyway, the anti-JA establishment would exploit the ‘contrast’ to smear him over and over, calling him “ambiguous and hypocrite” and inventing crap on crap.
[2015-09-07 07:39:04] <voidiss> Well, MGT has made a career — no more hidden FBI informant, but now public SENAIN whistleblower! Wow.

[2015-09-08 02:58:11] <Emmy B> Expecting Greece’s ‘closest’ allies to help her make her mind up, what will it be this time? skirmishes at the Albanian or FYROM border? Yet another hot incident around Agathonisi/Farmakonisi on the pretext of refugee rescue operations a naval standoff involving the death of innocent refugees? All eyes on the Greek interim government, can it hop and dance and walk on the unforgiving diplomatic rope?

[2015-09-08 03:36:26] <noll> “Germany could take 500,000 people per annum for years” – no offence to Germany or human nature, but this is insanely dangerous. still waiting for one person in MSM-land to have read sociology of *EU-wide* holocaust. http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/08/refugee-crisis-clashes-in-lesbos-live-updates#block-55eea7dfe4b0f3f3043acec8
[2015-09-08 03:54:46] <noll> Em, Assad having bad week, M5 highway threatened, Kafarya & al-Fu’ah besiege – by al-Nusra, by ISIS, Putin calls elections (in Syria, v. zero bullshit) & begins taking steps to bolster regime militarily. so, just what does US/ NATO think will happen if Assad falls – for a start w/ those numbers of refugees?
[2015-09-08 04:03:04] <Emmy B> Yes, no one really cares for the people of Syria full stop and what is going down there and soon on our streets is the madhouse that the US and allies ME policy have dreamed up and execute no matter what. Assad has been made irrelevant once the darling of UK he became the excuse.
[2015-09-08 04:11:10] <Emmy B> For me it also expresses a counter wave of authoritarianism against the Arab Spring. No more smoother than in Egypt where at least they are not been slaughtered and bombed, the army has finished with Mubarak regime and has found another client in the current regime. In Syria a wave for more democracy usurped by foreign actors and local factions seeking power at all costs. But really it has ended up in a mess of colonial dimensions.
[2015-09-08 04:15:18] <Emmy B> (cannot help but think that Ottoman massacres in the Peloponese, when riots happened they simply cleared whole regions through slaughter (survivors would become refugees) and then they would re-populate the area from another part of the empire.
[2015-09-08 04:15:57] <Emmy B> that is why I say of colonial dimensions)
[2015-09-08 04:18:09] <Emmy B> In Bahrain, the Saudis invaded, Libya disintegrated to barbarism, what remains of the Arab Spring?
[2015-09-08 05:34:22] <noll> Em, what remains, nothing. perhaps time for democracy in Syria was long before, not after. re FIO, Google translate: “There does not exist any compilation of the Prosecution’s total costs for the case.” https://twitter.com/hazelpress/status/641223916212613120

[2015-09-08 09:02:18] <Emmy B> maybe what remains of the Arab Spring is a stronger, more complete and more Arab …dream 🙂 a horizon to try and reach again in the future, better planned this time.
[2015-09-08 09:10:37] <noll> http://tass.ru/en/russia/819636
[2015-09-08 09:11:08] <noll> which is also down to Turkey?
[2015-09-08 09:26:31] <WikiLeaks> Turkey, Saudi, Qatar, Israel all want a piece of Syria.
[2015-09-08 09:28:09] <WikiLeaks> Once the government collapses the Turks will occupy it from the north, israel will cement its control over Goland and likely expand a buffer zone.
[2015-09-08 10:19:33] <Emmy B> This is simply the worst news for the region and my country and Cyprus it is a disaster. With Israel now a ‘strategic defence partner’ for both countries, (since the supposedly alienation of Turkey and Israel) and Israel an active player in gas exploration in Cyprus fields, their common military interests will drive them back in each others arms. If Turkey legitimises its hold in Cyprus which will allow her to expand its military bases there, (40,000 troops already there) it will be a springboard for military expansion beyond what can be imagined. The West is weaving chaos but others will benefit.
[2015-09-08 10:37:20] <noll> agree Wls. the C4 JA interview was really great. is there going to be a ‘complete’ version posted? at moment Arab Spring bit is ‘obscured’ (thought BBC had exclusive on that technique).

[2015-09-09 04:49:06] <noll> Greta, you can get glimpse of FSB psychological profile of Harding via type of gaslighting used – ie. he’s an Oxford simpleton. likely only a few theatrical skits, home triggers used, the rest was left to Harding’s absurd willingness to play the game. deniability of these techniques (usually targets that speak out are called insane rather than stupid) means they’re used *all the time, from families, groups, communities, businesses, govts, (v. often used against whistleblowers) but while it’s a nature form of attack, it’s also a powerful technology of social control that has been revolutionised since 1950s. but no one writes about its modern forms – which is interesting b/c when married to surveillance technologies it’s the stuff of nightmares. http://hazelpress.org/stasi-directive-zersetzung/4585259471

[2015-09-11 03:19:32] <voidiss> Hazelpress, your Western parallel should be explained to many journalists covering this issue right now; they would understand how absurd the situation is and why Ecuador govt is not so willing to deal with Fundamedios. I mean, you can’t consider it a unbiased media NGO campaigning for free speech — it is just backing US govt interests. Not that it’s not right highlighting abuses in Ecuador, but Fundamedios isn’t really the organization which should do this.

[2015-09-11 14:47:46] <voidiss> Oh. My. God. We’re really reaching absurd levels. As the article says, there’s a mad urge to find ‘offences’ everywhere.
[2015-09-11 14:47:56] <voidiss> Yes, sexism is widespread, in some environments more that others, but this is absolutely not the case, and especially, didn’t justified the public smear.

[2015-09-12 06:08:16] <voidiss> Oh, here is Nick Cohen a few days ago, engaged as usual in a smearing article against Corbyn. Hardly surprising. http://standpointmag.co.uk/node/6196/full
[2015-09-12 06:08:26] <voidiss> Just the start of the article is discourages the read. “Corbyn does not believe in the human rights of “us all”. He is concerned only with the rights of those whose oppression is politically useful. If the oppressed’s suffering can be blamed on the West, he will defend them. If not, he is on their enemies’ side.”
[2015-09-12 06:08:43] <voidiss> *without is
[2015-09-12 06:09:03] <voidiss> Curious how he uses a similar tactic as with JA smearing: claiming Corbyn is anti-West and willing to aid oppression if it comes from non-Westerners.

[2015-09-12 06:25:11] <voidiss> They’re freaking out.
[2015-09-12 06:51:16] <voidiss> I think the term “Corbynmania” can be seen as a preparation for the “political contagion” label. Worth noting Hague using it a few weeks ago: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11837521/Tony-Blair-was-a-Tory-leaders-worst-nightmare.-I-wish-Id-had-Jeremy-Corbyn-instead.html

[2015-09-12 09:11:04] <Emmy B> Yes I agree totally, there is though one very big difference regarding Corbyn. He is now an elected representative head of the opposition party and if the Tories attack it may hopefully encourage those within the Labour who are decent to defend the party and at last do their job ie OPPOSE the government 🙂
[2015-09-12 09:15:26] <noll> forgot to add link: http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2003-03-18&number=118&display=allpossible
[2015-09-12 09:25:24] <Emmy B> You know it will be delightful just to hear such political views and humanistic views in public.
[2015-09-12 09:27:26] <Emmy B> wherever I go I mostly feel that the most natural and humane ideas about peace and solidarity, about helping others and a more humane attitude in society away from competing on ‘the rat race’ and living in collaborate ways are just absent from the political vocabulary
[2015-09-12 09:31:19] <voidiss> Yes, completely absent, and this article – even if different on subject and presenting an already-well-known attitudes of politicians – shows it perfectly: https://theintercept.com/2015/09/11/today-14th-anniversary-enormous-opportunity/
[2015-09-12 09:31:22] <voidiss> Corbyn’s victory is a hope and I really wish he will keep the line he has shown by now. It could change many things. And seeing him at the demonstration right after the victory is telling.
[2015-09-12 09:32:06] <voidiss> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/medialens/status/642723270362591236 Obviously the presentation Guardian offers isn’t really the best ‘good luck’ wishes they could give.

[2015-09-13 05:44:26] <Emmy B> Thank you very much for recent postings, certainly highlight hypocrisy on both occasions: how can it ever be acceptable that donations are made by the coffers of one government for work by MP’s of another country? how can this MP not be described as ‘a foreign agent’?
[2015-09-13 05:50:12] <Emmy B> Equally, with UK’s UN submission, an act of clear aggression against another country, in that country’s sovereign soil, is ‘baptised’ into self defence and mentioning the octogenarian Queen to create understandable offence domestically crossing that red line in the English mind ‘these ppl our gov droned to death are traitors’. To quote my friend ‘if they planned to kill the queen they did right to kill them’.

[2015-09-13 08:41:02] <Emmy B> Returning to earlier comments regarding application of pressure on Greece to agree to block Russian aircraft from its FIR, I alluded to National security incidents surrounding Farmakonisi/Agathonisi (Turkey for decades tries to dispute Greek sovereignty over these islands – see Wikileaks cables for US role as mediator) to create ‘Grey/disputed zones’ in the Aegean. I mentioned earlier staged tragedies involving refugees…Sadly today many drowned in the very area. The capsizing under ‘mysterious circumstances’ according to a Greek publication. Article in English: http://www.ekathimerini.com/201472/article/ekathimerini/news/ten-refugees-drown-off-farmakonisi-dozens-rescued
[2015-09-13 08:49:09] <Emmy B> previously: http://www.cbsnews.com/news/uniformed-men-accost-refugees-leave-them-adrift-at-sea/
[2015-09-13 09:14:55] <voidiss> Oh, fuck. It’s damn frightening, this is precisely what you were talking about. The incident described in the second link could have been caused by Turkey, which then rescued the refugees to make it seem that it was Greece’s fault.
[2015-09-13 09:15:00] <voidiss> And about the drone strikes… the difference between the version given by Cameron and by the letter to UN is telling and should make people wonder. It’s like they don’t know which excuse to invent and they refine it day after day, just to fool everyone better.

[2015-09-13 09:29:20] <voidiss> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/WISEUpAction/status/642916206098411520 This article about refugees is great.
[2015-09-13 10:34:20] <noll> it’s good, but as slanted as you’d expect from article uncritically citing WSJ/ Fox etc. ie. the carefully selected BBC report is from 15 March – it was 16 March alleged torture of students that set the protest movement aflame, & the breathless “Wikileaks cables reveal CIA involvement” links to RT article which hides the fact that it is reporting on a US-backed cable station that no one watches & Assad opposition is too terrified to make a go of (https://search.wikileaks.org/advanced?q=%22Barada+TV%22&exclude_words=&words_title_only=&words_content_only=&publication_type%5B%5D=3&sort=3#results
[2015-09-13 10:54:18] <noll> correction – it’s 18 March (after Friday prayers) that protests begin to expand: https://classic.startpage.com/do/search?q=Syria+18+March+2011&l=english_uk
[2015-09-13 11:13:55] <Emmy B> In Greece we all celebrate proudly the day of oxi = no (1940 – WWII). It was not actually said as such but this is how it remains in history… as a ‘no you cannot pass your armies into Greece through the Albanian border Mussolini, we shall fight’. Together with the slight distortion of history (the word ‘no’ never was said, although Greece did not acquiesce to the Italian army advance and fought) most Greeks forget that Metaxas, the politician in charge of Greece at the time was a brutal dictator. He was a confirmed fascist who propagated everything that Mussolini and Hitler propagated albeit in a ancient Greek toga intellectual ‘garment’. Assad equally is a political dictator albeit considering the plurality of religions and nations within Syria, he is also the ‘tribal chief’ of the Allawites. Forgive me I am hardly an expert in matters Syrian but there is no doubt in my mind the Greeks would rather have Metaxa the dictator than Mussolini the dictator. I think most people can understand why. Mussolini too had a plan to split Greece into parts and in fact during the 4 years of occupation Greece was split into three parts The Italian, The German, The Bulgarian. Out of all three the Bulgarian was considered the most barbaric as ethnic cleansing was part of the agenda to truly expand Bulgaria giving it access into the Aegean. The current problems between Greece and FYROM or Macedonia over the name stem from that period of Bulgarian occupation when the occupiers (Bulgarians) to consolidate their rule and cement it for the future created the ‘greater Macedonia’ claiming it as a separate state, nation, in fact, and starting to manufacture the historic revisionism so helpful in propaganda. If the occupation had lasted longer than 4 years the map of Greece would today be very different. FYROM to this day includes in its national constitution a commitment to ‘liberate’ those historic lands that are currently under foreign control… all this referring to ‘the Greater Macedonian Myth’ created by Bulgarians in the 40’s. Forgive me the rather long dive into Greek history but I think it says a parallel story.
[2015-09-13 11:20:24] <Emmy B> Whilst in Greece it was the German colonialism that offered the Umbrella for all the land grab, in Syria it is American colonialism.
[2015-09-13 11:21:09] <Emmy B> It is shocking maybe to consider that both democratic and fascist ideologies can produce colonialism
[2015-09-13 11:21:42] <Emmy B> but then you can blame it on the Athenians (the first Democracy)
[2015-09-13 11:23:44] <Emmy B> Democracy in Syria has a future, but as it is at the moment the state may not survive… who knows but let’s take a look at this headline and agree that it could easily be about Syria: https://plus.google.com/113688791849949447824/posts/d858E7XQo9F
[2015-09-13 13:12:14] <Emmy B> ‘bairns not bombs’ & Corbyn’s doctrines might finally become the soft language under which a political reality coming home to roost (refugee waves into EU) becomes a foreign policy changer for Syria?
[2015-09-13 13:24:00] <Emmy B> Today is reported that Merkel said the Greeks should do a better job in guarding the EU’s external borders. A little too late, comes the realisation that indeed Greece is a border fortress. But interestingly NATO’s Greek military plan, executed at the cost of the Greek tax payer has been mainly deployed for an eminent USSR attack and not by an attack military or otherwise from any other direction. If the poor dingies can cross from Turkey to the Greek islands so easily, imagine how quickly modern military vessels can cross over and of course they trespass daily, who in EU has ever cared? I do hope that Isis does not spread into Turkey (God forbid they feed the monster, can they control it?) or else ‘island hopping’ the dream of every EU travelling teenager will acquire a very different meaning.
[2015-09-13 15:45:24] <voidiss> Thank you so much for all these interesting information and thoughts about Syria! Emmy, also very interesting your parallel with Greece at the time of WWII — Vico would say “occurrences and recurrences of history”.

[2015-09-14 02:25:22] <voidiss> Yes, it’s wrong that in Ecuador there’s a law which prevents journalists from intervening in political matters.
[2015-09-14 02:25:38] <voidiss> But in this case we’re not talking about genuine information about government opposition, but about intentional destabilization.
[2015-09-14 02:25:45] <voidiss> “Fundamedios only promoted the freedom of expression for certain institutions”, as the two guildes say.

Speech Given to Sydney University Law School, 31 March 2011
[2015-09-14 05:34:09] <Emmy B> Reflections on WikiLeaks, Spycatcher and Freedom of the Press
[2015-09-14 05:35:32] <Emmy B> sorry not video but an audio recording
[2015-09-14 05:45:27] <Emmy B> there are slight differences between the article and the podcast, the latter being (I think in a language and tone) more supportive of JA
[2015-09-14 05:46:20] <Emmy B> I quote ” Sarah Palin, possibly the next US President, called for him to be pursued “with the same urgency we pursue al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders.” No doubt her supporters were able to read what they liked into that remark.
While Assange is no doubt quite safe from assassination, when an Australian citizen is threatened in this way, an Australian Prime Minister should respond.”
[2015-09-14 05:47:29] <Emmy B> let’s hope MT is a man of his word 🙂 shame the article and podcast is no longer in his website, unless they have been moved in a different URL inside it.
[2015-09-14 05:59:31] <Emmy B> of course any efforts to potentially assist JA from Oz for MT to keep face could be potentially sabotaged by the High Commissioner Alexander Downer, notorious in my book, let’s hope JA’s Oz legal representation try their hand directly with the new PM in Oz.
[2015-09-14 06:22:41] <Bean> sorry to disappoint but MT is certainly not a man of his word – he’s a multimillionaire career politician – just one example: http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-05/no-internet-filter-says-turnbull/4939156
[2015-09-14 06:24:06] <Bean> he’s smarter than abbott which just makes him more dangerous – and possibly electable
[2015-09-14 06:29:08] <Emmy B> Thanks for the resources Bean 🙂 good to know, I have no particular knowledge of who is who in Australian politics. His expressed views regarding JA/WL as expressed in the podcast lecture to Sydney Uni is widely differentiated than other Australian politicians. In particular I am not aware that anyone has ever given a Uni lecture on the matter so in that respect he may find it hard to publicly retract all 41 minutes of it.
[2015-09-14 06:30:37] <voidiss> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/jaraparilla/status/643360024597651456 MT’s statement is surely rather positive; even if he didn’t approve WL’s action completely, he seemed to care about protection for JA about assassinations. But… this is what @garymlord thinks about those MT’s words:
[2015-09-14 06:31:32] <voidiss> Also, given what Bean has just said and comparing it with how Australiam MSM are depicting him, there’s a discordance: http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/liberal-leadership-the-malcolm-turnbull-doctrine-telling-the-truth-about-economy-20150914-gjmfyc.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=nc&eid=socialn%3Atwi-13omn1677-edtrl-other%3Annn-17%2F02%2F2014-edtrs_socialshare-all-nnn-nnn-vars-o%26sa%3DD%26usg%3DALhdy28zsr6qiq
[2015-09-14 06:32:54] <Emmy B> Having successfully defended the publication of Spycatcher (am I right?) matters of press freedom/freedom of expression and the law have been linked to his professional career (i.e. things he is proud of and added to his professional/political standing) He is not reached the highest office without getting his hands dirty so he will certainly put political expediency above other matters, still threes a wind of change and he may want to play his own tune.
[2015-09-14 06:39:55] <Emmy B> He is hardly condoning of WL anyway only that to me at least it is clear he considers their actions to be journalistic and they should not be prosecuted/persecuted. He also criticises US for doing so.
[2015-09-14 06:45:13] <Bean> would he still do this in power? – i’m sceptical – haven’t time to expand or find decent material on him at the moment (sorry!) – but my impression of him over the years is as a very slippery character – a cunning manipulator
[2015-09-14 06:47:34] <voidiss> I’ve found another earlier piece in which we talks about WikiLeaks disclosure, immediately after the release of the Cablegate: https://web.archive.org/web/20101210041630/http://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/blogs/julian-assange-and-wikileaks/
[2015-09-14 08:06:42] <Emmy B> Let’s watch what he does then. I don’t follow Australian politics other what comes into my timeline, why was Abbot ousted…?
[2015-09-14 08:24:45] <Bean> so unpopular now he would lose the next election – seen as mismanaging economy (amongst other things) as the australian economy slides due to too many eggs in the chinese resources market basket (try repeating that fast!)…the usual internal factional battles within the liberal party (not that they have ‘official’ factions like labor)…abbott knifed turnbull in the back to get leadership when in opposition (by one vote in 2009) so payback time… turnbull has had his eye on being pm for years and the time was right to roll abbott – now gives them chance to win next election with a new (old) face – turnbull has credibility in eyes of many liberal Liberal voters… that’s my quick and crude analysis!
[2015-09-14 08:26:32] <Emmy B> Thank you!!! 🙂
[2015-09-14 08:26:54] <noll> it’s good news re climate change action :o) “Turnbull hit the airwaves, declaring he would not back down or resign, and that the Liberal party would be annihilated if it took a “do nothing” position on climate change. Echoing Prime Minister Rudd, he warned that taking no action on climate change risked “the future of our planet and the future of our children and their children” https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09CANBERRA1053_a.html
[2015-09-14 08:29:11] <Emmy B> Let’s hope so!

[2015-09-14 08:58:24] <voidiss> For now Turnbull has said “no changes” on the current climate change policy, and even said that Abbott government’s “climate policy is one that has been very well designed, a very, very good piece of work”.

[2015-09-14 23:13:24] <voidiss> Agree. And all the recent statements by Swedish govt in this period about strenghten coop w/ NATO are a further confirmation.

[2015-09-15 12:21:32] <Emmy B> I don’t understand satire unless it is Greek. Maybe that is why I do not appreciate these cartoons, but neither do I like to see the image of a dead child used. I understand and are moved by pictures reporting the carnage or tragedy as documenting what happened but why have so many people reproduced this image 10,000 in all kinds of ways I don’t understand why it should be acceptable. It has become a commodity for public consumption.

[2015-09-16 08:57:51] <Emmy B> Just so people know there is now evidence with the German Court that FWLF is owned by [redacted] wife of MGT and registered at the address that MGT lives. The French hosting co of wikileaks .com has provided documentary evidence after a French court order. Chris has been very busy over the summer and her appeal has been submitted a few weeks ago. MGT is aware of this development. Now awaiting for further legal steps but have no timeline. Please show discretion. There is no need for this information to be the subject of twitter exchanges at this stage. FWLF twitter account was suspended for a period of 10 days due to Chris’s complaint for targeted abuse. FWLF has deleted some but not all offending tweets. I personally do not expect any further news on the subject till christmas.

[2015-09-18 04:47:27] <Emmy B> apologies for the unpleasantness
[2015-09-18 04:51:44] <Emmy B> for a moment there I thought I read ‘cuties’ instead of ‘culties’ then WL could be accused once more of sexism hahahaha
[2015-09-18 04:53:17] <Emmy B> Goodmorning!
[2015-09-18 05:19:40] <voidiss> Oh LOL, WL! Good morning to you too, ahah!
[2015-09-18 05:19:50] <voidiss> That abusive petition is disgusting, Emmy, my god.
[2015-09-18 05:49:02] <voidiss> There is an ongoing “game under the covers” for Sweden to join NATO’s task force against Russia — as always http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=&sl=sv&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.svd.se%2Fhemlig-process-tar-sverige-mot-natos-elitstyrka%2Fom%2Fdet-skarpta-sakerhetslaget&sandbox=1
[2015-09-18 06:37:57] <Emmy B> 🙂 What is more disgusting Greta is the fact that more than 2500 people signed the petition in support of WL through the Avaaz system but whoever set it up was false and these signatures of support were never registered with the EU parliament. I think twice before I sign any Avaaz petition since. If it used as an instrument of fraud with no accountability on behalf of Avaaz then what sort of political democratic platform is it?
[2015-09-18 06:48:26] <WikiLeaks> We hear from a parliamentarian in Norway that there is last minute tension in the Nobel Peace Prize committee between a Snowden-Assange-Manning triumvirate vs 2nd prize to Obama.
[2015-09-18 06:49:10] <Emmy B> The very best of Luck! <3
[2015-09-18 06:59:42] <voidiss> Wow! This’d be amazing, good luck! And also it’d be a funny shot agst Obama – think of his shock knowing he has lost the prize b/cos of you!
[2015-09-18 07:01:09] <voidiss> Emmy, yes, I understand your point and you’re right. It surprises me, I thought Avaaz was a pretty good and reliable org.
[2015-09-18 07:01:12] <voidiss> Sad to know the contrary.
[2015-09-18 07:30:35] <WikiLeaks> Avaaz and all such petition systems are scams.
[2015-09-18 07:30:45] <WikiLeaks> Highly profitable scams.
[2015-09-18 07:31:34] <WikiLeaks> They place their credit card donation buttons next to the petition. People have the false impression that they are donating to the cause of the petition, but they’re just donating to Avaaz et al.
[2015-09-18 07:32:14] <WikiLeaks> They stalk mediagenic issues to pull in people to that killing zone.
[2015-09-18 07:33:37] <WikiLeaks> We hear that they give/sell their lists to the US democrats. If you look closely at the Avaaz privacy policy, at least as it was a few years ago, you can see that type of thing is not excluded.
[2015-09-18 07:36:15] <WikiLeaks> They had a 750k strong petition to free JA. We spoke to them at the highest level about the possibility of emailing those people with a WL announcement on some issue (e.g manning trial), which they did not. So they collected a very large list of people that would have been critical to our fight, but only used it for their own purposes.
[2015-09-18 07:37:25] <Emmy B> yes I also send them an e-mail about it but they ignored me.
[2015-09-18 07:38:14] <Emmy B> http://greekemmy.com/2014/03/22/a-curious-matter-with-avaaz-petition-wikileaks-stop-the-crackdown/
[2015-09-18 07:39:21] <Emmy B> Thanks for this insight! I have always wondered about that petition.
[2015-09-18 07:39:40] <Emmy B> But there is something of a worry because….
[2015-09-18 07:40:47] <Emmy B> they are now seen as a platform for progressives in the UK for example to launch political action… give me a minute to find the link so that I explain better….
[2015-09-18 07:42:35] <Emmy B> see here: http://norml-uk.org/2014/02/caroline-lucas-drug-petition-100k-signatures/
[2015-09-18 07:43:17] <voidiss> Oh. Thank you very much for the info. Great, I add Avaaz to the already-long list of crappy orgs.
[2015-09-18 07:43:50] <voidiss> If I think it’s been one of the first platforms I used to inform myself abt impo issues before knowing WL a few years ago, I want to vomit.
[2015-09-18 07:44:00] <voidiss> Anyway, I agree with Emmy. Not just in the UK — also in Italy many people see it as a good platform.
[2015-09-18 07:44:04] <voidiss> And in fact I was advised to read some of their campaigns by a number of teachers here.
[2015-09-18 07:44:18] <Emmy B> http://www.avaaz.org/en/uk_epetition/
[2015-09-18 07:45:00] <Emmy B> http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10637699/Drug-laws-may-be-debated-in-Commons-as-petition-passes-100000-threshold.html
[2015-09-18 07:46:51] <Emmy B> Basically Caroline Lucas campaign was joined by Russel Brand’s initiative via Avaaz who EMBEDDED the UK parliament petition into their Avaaz Petition and sent it to their 1.1 UK e-mails.
[2015-09-18 07:47:49] <Emmy B> quote” Alice Jay, Avaaz campaign director, said: ” This petition shows people want politicians to step up and change Britain’s disastrous drug laws.” unquote
[2015-09-18 07:50:33] <Emmy B> So, Avaaz 1. Collects donations, 2. Collects our data, 3.’stalk mediagenic issues to pull in people to that killing zone’ 4. Sells our data 5. Enters the political arena influencing UK legislative Policy 6. sells itself to politicians as a political player…isn’t this the realm of political lobbying or am I wrong?
[2015-09-18 07:53:40] <Emmy B> The WL example of that petition is very telling as Avaaz on this occasion used WL’s reach (the petition was promoted via WL FB page (at the time of ‘the Siggi/MGT partnership’ to mention a sore point) to get to add into their database.
[2015-09-18 07:56:24] <Emmy B> another lesson learnt
[2015-09-18 08:03:16] <Emmy B> And have they ever made a petition about Manning? I am going to check this…
[2015-09-18 08:03:51] <Emmy B> But I recall they did one for Snowden the one run by David Miranda…hang on…
[2015-09-18 08:05:05] <Emmy B> yes, here it is: https://sg.news.yahoo.com/brazil-39-snowden-petition-hits-1-mn-signatures-212335747.html
[2015-09-18 08:06:02] <Emmy B> I remember because I was asked by an activist friend to translate it to Greek and they forwarded it to their network of contacts in Greece, e-mail lists etc.
[2015-09-18 08:06:30] <Emmy B> How easily are we duped as public?
[2015-09-18 08:11:25] <voidiss> Yes, they did one about Manning in 2010/11, this link is in Italian: https://secure.avaaz.org/it/bradley_manning/?cl=1014776318&v=8817
[2015-09-18 08:12:04] <voidiss> ‘Another lesson learnt”: absolutely yes.
[2015-09-18 08:17:13] <Emmy B> So what does the petition say Greta and did they submit it to a public organisation in support of Manning?
[2015-09-18 08:23:26] <Emmy B> how do you know the date Greta, I don’t see it mentioned… curious…
[2015-09-18 08:29:54] <Emmy B> it says : ‘Sign the petition: our message will be delivered through a poster impact and strong actions in Washington DC as soon as we reach 250,000 signatures.’ were there posters put up in Washington? and what strong actions were taken I wonder….
[2015-09-18 09:04:19] <Emmy B> Nobel peace prize 2015 http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2015/
[2015-09-18 09:33:19] <voidiss> Sorry, I was out.
[2015-09-18 09:33:38] <voidiss> Anyway, I’ve found the same petition link in English here: http://www.avaaz.org/en/bradley_manning/
[2015-09-18 09:34:05] <voidiss> I know it is from 2010/2011 b/cos I saw it in that period, I received the email (I followed Avaaz newsletter, as I said).
[2015-09-18 09:34:47] <voidiss> After that email I didn’t personally see new developments, but it may have been due to my inability to inform myself properly at the time.
[2015-09-18 09:34:59] <voidiss> At the top of that article they claimed Manning was moved to a less strict prison thanks to their petition and the 500.000 signatures.
[2015-09-18 09:35:16] <voidiss> But I’ve searched a bit online and I have found no links about protests in Washington DC for Manning organized by Avaaz.
[2015-09-18 09:35:47] <voidiss> Also on Manning support website they recognized the big amount of support the initiative had raised, but said
[2015-09-18 09:35:47] <Emmy B> thank you Greta!
[2015-09-18 09:36:02] <voidiss> “according to the site the petition will be delivered to Washington etc etc”,
[2015-09-18 09:36:06] <voidiss> not that it has actually been delivered: http://www.chelseamanning.org/news/avaaz-org-joins-the-fight-to-stop-the-torture-of-bradley-manning
[2015-09-18 09:38:13] <Emmy B> hmmm
[2015-09-18 09:49:33] <Emmy B> Avaaz risk taking in Syria is unprecedent http://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/smuggling-aid-campaign-group-avaaz-plays-key-syria-role
[2015-09-18 09:52:11] <M> On Avaaz, from Jillian C York: “They are not a 501(c)(3) (non-profit) organization, rather, they are a 501(c)(4), the classification of organization that can lobby, engage in political campaigns, and don’t have to name their major donors. To put this in perspective, the 501(c)(4) designation applies to PACs[.]” http://jilliancyork.com/2012/05/29/on-avaaz/
[2015-09-18 09:54:41] <WikiLeaks> Jesus. And they say WikiLeaks has blood on its hands.
[2015-09-18 10:06:39] <M> But apparently Avaaz lied about their scope of involvement in that! http://www.newrepublic.com/article/world/103330/syria-avaaz-activist-group-journalism
[2015-09-18 10:08:49] <Emmy B> corruption then through and through?
[2015-09-18 10:55:14] <Emmy B> I thought at the time I had that experience with the JA petition turned tool of abuse, that I could make Avaaz reveal who done it, the e-mail and IP addresses would have been enough but the only thing they did do is to de-publish the petition, then no action, no answers.
[2015-09-18 11:05:24] <Emmy B> I read in their terms and conditions that I would need a court order or a police order to get them to reveal who manipulated the petition, in the US probably…I thought it would be too complicated and expensive. So after several e-mails and phone calls to their UK media guys I gave up.
[2015-09-18 11:31:33] <Emmy B> Re Avaaz, here it is said it was created by moveOn that fundraised for Obama: https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/30/3084699_iran-middle-east-no-spring-in-lebanon-.html
[2015-09-18 11:32:25] <Emmy B> it says it attended The Syrian Opposition Antalya conference
[2015-09-18 11:33:11] <Emmy B> that called for the overthrow of Assad: http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/the-final-declaration-of-the-antalya-opposition-conference/
[2015-09-18 11:35:39] <Emmy B> What is MoveOn https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoveOn.org
[2015-09-18 11:39:42] <Emmy B> ‘In 2007, Moveon was a co-founder of Avaaz, a similar organization with an international focus.’
[2015-09-18 11:45:25] <Emmy B> So clearly they have a US political campaigning background and they split their service into three areas, 1. Petition Campaigning of their own volition, 2. Petition services open to all members (I think one has to pay to have their petition circulate within the Avaaz e-mail list) 3. Action on the ground including Extra ordinary activities eg camera’s and medical aid to Syrian opposition.
[2015-09-18 11:46:11] <Emmy B> I wonder who was the european partner mentioned in the article.
[2015-09-18 11:48:18] <Emmy B> Also, now that we know about what GCHQ are up to regarding manipulation of public opinion via the Snowden revelations, one has to wonder how easy it would be to have a pool of a few hundred thousand e-mail addresses handy for influencing on line campaigning.
[2015-09-18 11:51:20] <Emmy B> I mean…if a mere MGT can create fake members for his forum 24/7 round the clock (maybe using fake e-mail addresses, maybe using special software to manipulate simple machines software set up (who knows?) imagine the opportunities for faking online petitions.
[2015-09-18 12:12:16] <voidiss> Oh-oh. I know which is the European partner: Res Publica https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ResPublicahttps://archive.is/z1evm#selection-517.0-517.227https://archive.is/tqLTK#selection-1143.250-1143.672https://archive.is/GSQr9#selection-613.150-613.217http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/alexsingleton/100018739/is-phillip-blond-now-david-camerons-most-influential-thinker/
[2015-09-18 12:12:20] <voidiss> So apparently Avaaz has its roots both in MoveOn fundraising for Obama, and in ResPublica whose director has ties with Tories. Telling?
[2015-09-18 12:12:44] <voidiss> Anyway, completely agree with Emmy about the danger of such a platform.
[2015-09-18 12:13:15] <voidiss> And they’re dangerous because they’re not just corrupted and lying, they’re even completely incompetent in matter of security/technology and yet they were pretending to be able to offer a good and reliable supply of satellite phones to Syrians etc. Without caring about someone else’s life. But well, if they sell lists to US democrats, they’re not going to be held accountable for those possible lives losses, of course.
[2015-09-18 12:28:20] <Emmy B> {heh frontpagemag US perspective of what is left (eg Obama 2012) hilarious…}
[2015-09-18 12:28:56] <Emmy B> Excellent links Greta…reading <3
[2015-09-18 12:44:37] <Emmy B> Very good the frontpagemag article Greta, thank you so much for sharing.
[2015-09-18 12:46:36] <Emmy B> and phillip blond article reminds me this clip from ‘my fair lady’ from rags to riches…I hope you will find entertaining https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozSNCqGP3yU
[2015-09-18 13:03:07] <Emmy B> What are ‘think tanks’ Res Publica and Demos doing at Party Conferences? are they also lobbyists? who is funding these groups?
[2015-09-18 13:08:43] <Emmy B> Greta your articles take me further and further into ‘the business of politics’ it seems like a parallel political area exists of formulating ideas and delivering them, outside the more traditional democratic institutions who deliver political thinking, platforms and action, ie political parties, occupational unions, associations and professional institutes.
[2015-09-18 13:13:49] <Emmy B> It is a kind of elitist world of political formulation & engagement platforms financed by who is not exactly clear ‘I have raised gbp 1.5 mill in two weeks’ he says… but seeking to influence traditional institutions of policy making…hmm who would have thought Avaaz was the pseudo grass roots arm of such crypto lobbyist groups.
[2015-09-18 13:14:45] <voidiss> About “who funds Res Publica and Demos”, I’ve found this project: http://whofundsyou.org/abouthttp://whofundsyou.org/org/demoshttp://whofundsyou.org/org/respublicahttp://www.politicalinnovation.org/2012/06/new-website-highlights-secretive-world-of-think-tank-funding/
[2015-09-18 13:15:26] <voidiss> I agree with you, Emmy. Also, despite the bias in the article, Frontpagemag highlighted that Avaaz founders were connected to Soros’ OSF. I’m not so well informed on OSF/Soros, but what I know is that they have a huge influence and they control many things in the world and, as some people like Glenn Beck think, also in politics… so it’s not reassuring.
[2015-09-18 13:15:52] <voidiss> Listen now to the clip!
[2015-09-18 13:22:37] <Emmy B> thanks for sharing, excellent work Greta, had no idea these sites existed, well look at that: ‘TaxPayers’ Alliance’ also an ‘E” like Res Publica and they are the horrid guys who are quoted recently by Daily Mail
[2015-09-18 13:23:30] <Emmy B> i believe, regarding taxpayers money spent on MetPol for the embassy siege…let me see..

[2015-09-20 13:36:42] <noll> whatever’s left of Syriza wins: http://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2015/sep/20/greek-election-live-results
[2015-09-20 13:47:02] <Emmy B> 45% abstain – unprecedent
[2015-09-20 13:48:28] <Emmy B> GD some gains at 7% even after their leader publicly took political responsibility for the death of Fyssas this is terrible.
[2015-09-20 13:51:08] <Emmy B> Still relief, on my part, that ECB’s ‘coup’ that led to capitulation of syriza and its subsequent split did not lead to a situation where no clear winner
[2015-09-20 13:52:10] <Emmy B> would have deeply destabilised the country.
[2015-09-20 13:56:23] <noll> 45% abstain.. result is still ‘better’ than we feared. thank god GD aren’t just awful, but also politically inept, Syria crisis is giving them (& entire EU far-right) a golden opportunity w/ no end in sight.. agree, think ECB/ EU etc will step in if situ’ becomes catastrophic, after all they own the place. speaking of which – when will they step in to barricade that boarder, not that it’s possible.
[2015-09-20 13:58:57] <noll> far earlier than expected – here comes fortress EU. maybe Syriza were correct to stay w/i at any cost, considering future realities.
[2015-09-20 13:59:01] <Emmy B> the northern border was barricaded years ago I will share some links because this is going to be in the news soon. Winter is coming soon and ppl will reduce sea crossings
[2015-09-20 14:03:32] <Emmy B> Evros is natural river and the border with turkey, it has changed shape over the years so border has to be periodically re-agreed which is impossible considering the bad neighbour that Turkey is, in relation to challenging Greek sovereignty, sea air and land, and its invasion/occupation of Cyprus.
[2015-09-20 14:14:57] <Emmy B> Thraki or Thrace is the name of the Greek prefecture bordering Turkey. It is also home to the only Greek Muslim minority (about 120,000 ethnic Greek, Roma,Turkish, Pomak who are Muslims – the Greek gov does not recognise them as ethnic minorities only as a religious minority). This group of Muslims were excluded from the mutually organised ethnic cleansing of the (odious) 1923 Treaty of Lausanne (exchange population). Just as a note the 120,000 equivalent Greek Orthodox Istanbul minority also excluded by the same treaty is now down to 2,000 souls (eg see 1955 Istanbul progrom). These tit-bits are important.
[2015-09-20 14:17:36] <Emmy B> So the only land border with Turkey (due to the river) is about 10 kilometres and it was fenced off in 2012.
[2015-09-20 14:18:00] <Emmy B> https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/5236d119e4b0c9a06407dd97/516264
[2015-09-20 14:22:04] <Emmy B> note the reference to anti-personal mines https://euobserver.com/fortress-eu/118565
[2015-09-20 14:28:50] <Emmy B> The articles of course do not mention the drug trade that follows the same routes as the flow of migration. some who served their national service guarding the border pre-fence claim, Greek army (unofficially) had the policy of non interference with people smugglers as it was extremely dangerous. Guards were advised to not engage ‘duck and dive’.
[2015-09-20 14:30:22] <Emmy B> Some ppl still attempt to cross Evros by boat or swim, and many also die in the process.
[2015-09-20 14:32:32] <Emmy B> in Feb this year some voices were heard about allowing refugees to cross https://clandestinenglish.wordpress.com/2015/02/12/evros-fence-openings-for-refugees-not-sans-papiers/
[2015-09-20 14:33:19] <Emmy B> I would imagine that maybe Syriza’s re-election may follow a humane approach
[2015-09-20 14:34:05] <Emmy B> Frontex is in operation there, part of its role documenting people.
[2015-09-20 14:37:03] <Emmy B> If Oslo II (ppl who enter into EU must remain within country of entry) is over this is excellent news for Greece, it will gladly facilitate passage through Greece. If EU let’s Greece sink further and further under the burden that is when GD will double its %.
[2015-09-20 14:40:39] <Emmy B> Currently there are about 2000 refugees awaiting to cross into Greece in Adrianupoli (Turkish name Edirne) http://news.yahoo.com/refugees-dispersed-turkey-greece-border-buses-085559067.html
[2015-09-20 15:02:13] <Emmy B> and a short video : http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/sep/17/refugees-protest-edirne-turkey-appealing-for-passage-into-greece-video

[2015-09-20 15:34:09] <Emmy B> yes, interesting articles, we must be aware though of ideology been used to mask pure greed. Is climate change going to be merely used for further resource grabbing via a ‘we must manage resources better’ plot of international control? Certainly resources are finite but resourcefulness is not. We have seen medicine/technological advances lead to population explosion but also a widening of the standards of living further. Are we also going to see further restrictions on individual freedom in the name of climate change? it seems in our world every good thing (eg national security is supposedly a good thing) is turned on its head and becomes a nightmare. Upholding Human Rights internationally is a good thing but has been turned on its head to justify illegal invasion, even ethnic cleansing. Let’s hope Climate Change agenda stays on track and is not hijacked but the power hungry.
[2015-09-20 16:33:22] <noll> agree, think (w/o scrolling back for eternity) Wls mentioned climate-opportunism, guess Arctic policy’s visibility makes it a gd. example. anyway, to widen things out: that there is a climate crisis at all – w/ < 2°C *still achievable – is, as w/ the Arctic etc, a political choice. in this insane reality, just imagine the rest going forwards? agendas of greed & expediency followed by s̶o̶m̶e̶t̶h̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶e̶c̶h̶n̶o̶l̶o̶g̶i̶c̶a̶l desperate necessity? & we all know how bad the former often gets.

[2015-09-21 02:16:48] <voidiss> Abt Syriza election… I find everything really sad. Tsipras’s been re-elected w/ complete different purpose compared to his initial wish of
[2015-09-21 02:17:17] <voidiss> fighting back austerity, which now he has to implement. It’s tragic & telling of how expert the EU has been in forcing Greece to its knees.

[2015-09-21 02:18:35] <voidiss> Like this quote, which underlines EU has lost its fear for Tsipras’ strong/not submissive line b/c it has actually been able to break it.
[2015-09-21 02:19:50] <voidiss> “There was talk of an austerity party breaking the mould of post “great recession” politics. EU political establishment looked on in horror.
[2015-09-21 02:20:05] <voidiss> The financial markets trembled. All the euphoria and most of the apprehension had disappeared by the time Greeks voted today.”

[2015-09-21 06:57:44] <Emmy B> I watched his documentary dirty wars here in London, it was good and an excellent panel with Tom Watson MP, Reprieve (if I am not mistaken) with K Hrafnsson moderated by J. Robinson lead to a discussion and Q&A
[2015-09-21 06:59:15] <Emmy B> ‘they are the war masters’ one said about the US in the film
[2015-09-21 07:10:03] <Emmy B> When did this come about?out of no where we have istanbul conference? http://carnegieendowment.org/syriaincrisis/?fa=61336
[2015-09-21 07:36:01] <noll> dirty wars is great, but would have been significantly better if briefly covered US interests in Gulf of Aden, tapestry of other national interests, how relates to historical/ cultural background. the simplistic “[b/c] they are the war masters” narrative doesn’t really cut it, esp. when material above is so informative/ important. obviously, a black hole of complexity looms, nevertheless, the all important ‘why’, the plot, if carefully managed could have taken 15 mins interspersed.

[2015-09-21 10:00:38] <noll> thanks Greta, they’re “conservatively” calculating cost of $1.98 trillion per year up until 2200. in 2013 global GDP was around 75.59. so that’s less than 2.6% global GDP per year. this is sea levels from 2°C projected to 2200: http://www.climatecentral.org/news/how-2C-warming-could-reshapeus-19209

[2015-09-22 02:56:04] <Emmy B> Wonderful resources! thank you 🙂 research note there is more than one tags in wl dot org re Wilson , Harold Wilson and James Harold Wilson, there might be more.
[2015-09-22 02:59:17] <Emmy B> gave Daily Mail some money today for all the piggate laughs 🙂 but it is something to consider that just as the Mirror chose to print the pencourt files, making them into ‘news’, so has the Daily mail, he has made Ashcroft’s story (which would never have had such reach or credibility within a wider audience) the ‘news’ of the day. There was a choice there.
[2015-09-22 03:06:32] <Emmy B> Maybe we can entertain ourselves with the idea that those with real power disliked Cameron’s Tory lead regarding the Corbyn election. His ‘honesty’ in branding him first a bofoon (pre-election)- a clear expression of arrogance of the powerful towards the commoners and then ‘a national security risk’ (after his election) giving legitimacy to all conspiracy claims that the elit subverts democracy, whilst such operation and efforts to divert democracy must always remain covert so that public claims of it can be dismissed as ‘conspiracy theories of the loonie party’ ie…blunders all around
[2015-09-22 03:09:56] <Emmy B> he’s been taken down a peg or two I am sure by his own who may now prepare the ground for a different Tory leader as a better oppositional match to Corbyn who may be seen as having a good chance with the electorate, despite whatever internal treason is planned from within the Labour party.
[2015-09-22 03:14:32] <Emmy B> It is this wind of change in a democracy that once going it is hard to curtail. See Tsipras winning again despite the gravest humiliation he endured, an internal split, accusations of betraying a referendum, a bankrupt country, and an uncontrollable wave of refugees adding to the already mature humanitarian disaster. hmmm just maybe?
[2015-09-22 03:24:18] <Emmy B> extremely difficult to consider who would be best to replace Cameron, the big challenge comes next year with a EU referendum, obviously the Country (the interests it represents) needs to stay in EU but with conditions. Corbyn may wish to stay but he left the question open ‘let’s see what the PM will bring at the table’ he could easily say ‘no’ based on these details (ie HR/ECHR issues etc) rather than general idea of leaving the EU and get away with it, not to mention that by doing so he will wipe off UKIP from many ex labour voters who will return to Labour where they most naturally belong. The Tories need a very skilled skipper to navigate through these perils and deliver the goods 🙂 watching with interest!

[2015-09-22 10:43:12] <Emmy B> @ Greta also remember if it is the state that collects the info and state representatives that blackmail and store the info then info collected on a person can be used for several generations, for people who wish to have a public life the transgressions of relatives whether criminal or otherwise all become live ammunition at a particular time in the future. In families whose history goes back centuries as this country boasts through the preservation of Aristocracy still active in public life through Monarchy and House of Lords as well as economic life, such power groups are entrenched deeply through marriage as well as interest as well as what your article describes.
[2015-09-22 10:48:56] <Emmy B> Betrayal of class is a notion that describes a moral duty to one’s group. Amongst his own Cameron will always have a place, he will not be socially excluded even if he loses PMship, it will become a footnote, history has forgiven worse. ‘They are all at it’

[2015-09-22 14:06:49] <voidiss> This mere fact tells us how “good” Avaaz is considered among the majority of people. As WL said, it’s great at getting involved with “mediagenic issues”.
[2015-09-22 14:06:52] <voidiss> About PigGate, thank you Emmy, I agree. It has somehow hilarious nuance, that precisely the storage of personal information is what in the end can pose a threat to govt members themselves. A sort of backlash. The sad thing is that they willingly accept the game in order to gain the position they want and the career they dream. So in the end it’s a useless backlash, it just gives some more hypocrisy.

[2015-09-26 18:08:25] <voidiss> Very interesting article about climate change; the author finds a possible solution in a “global non-violent constitutional climate insurgency” — and actually I think that governments have come to the same conclusion and have understood that this would be the approach, that’s why they’re trying to “criminalize” environmentalism everywhere, to foil their major narrative of “legality of civil disobedience” from the start (Australia with #FreeKaren is just the latest example of a long list) http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/32933-reversing-climate-change-what-will-it-take
[2015-09-26 18:10:15] <voidiss> In theory this idea has a great potential, imo, but I can’t understand if it might actually work. Yes, on this issue there’s a tendency of populations to act more and on a vaster scale than on other issues, but it seems really difficult to coordinate all the singular movements on a global scale, and either that they would succeed in build the common belief that “governments are acting in an illegal way”. There are still too many people that doesn’t perceive climate change as an immediate threat, and moreover, the idea of the State being “inherently good” is still entrenched in the average people — in the end, it’s a concept that comes to us from antiquity. I think the process of perception reversal would take too long…

[2015-09-28 10:06:31] <LibertarianLibrarian> I’m taking a class on ‘Health in the Headlines” – I shouldn’t be shocked on how bad health journalism is, I knew that, but still… It remains stupefying. I co-teach a class on clinical research here in the Program in Public Health, the journalism students should be required to take it or something like it.
[2015-09-28 11:29:06] <voidiss> Oh, what you’re saying makes me remember that article about the experiment of fooling media with the “chocolate is good for your diet” claim. I was pretty shocked reading that the media actually believed it, things seem really bad in the health journalism sector.
[2015-09-28 11:29:30] <voidiss> By the way, Corbyn is definitely great. https://twitter.com/OpNimr/status/647818221949685760
[2015-09-28 11:35:35] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, health/medical journalism is in terrible shape, most journalists don’t have any understanding and assume that a PhD or University spokesperson knows everything and don’t question it, without looking into conflicts of interest or checking the actual data or studies for quality. Typical of modern journalism. Don’t question ‘authorities’, just go for the nice headline.
[2015-09-28 11:36:21] <LibertarianLibrarian> Corbyn does seem pretty cool. Wish we had someone like that running instead of the morons I’ve got to decide amongst.
[2015-09-28 11:40:48] <WikiLeaks> Corbyn is solid, his party is full of evil though.
[2015-09-28 11:43:02] <WISE Up Action> Hi Jenny, just on Trump, are the tactics he used on his Scottish property development known about in US? http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/22/donald-trump-bbc-film-row
[2015-09-28 11:44:57] <voidiss> About the similarities and differences between Corbyn and Sanders in the US, there is this interesting interview with Chomsky — which actually is broader, about movements of change and current capitalist system: http://www.salon.com/2015/09/25/noam_chomsky_bernie_sanders_cant_save_america_partner/
[2015-09-28 11:48:22] <LibertarianLibrarian> I don’t know about Trump’s Scottish property development, but I can believe just about anything about his business practices. He’s already falling; his early poll results were just surprise, celebrity name value, and irritation with typical politicians. No one wants another Clinton or Bush race. At least not anyone I know. But Trump’s a moron trading on celebrity status and even against the rest of the idiots running, he won’t actually get far. It’s still over a year to go.
[2015-09-28 11:50:45] <LibertarianLibrarian> There are things I like about Sanders and things that bother me. My parents will vote for him, though they don’t think he has a chance. I think they’re wrong, I think he could beat Clinton. I just wish he stood up better on a number of my key issues and I worry about how much some of his promises, if he got them through, would cost the taxpayer. I’m not yet convinced on him yet.
[2015-09-28 11:54:05] <LibertarianLibrarian> Actually, I feel about Sanders like I do about Rand Paul — sometimes they nail it, sometimes they really F* it up. Unless my party, Libertarians, come up with an actually strong candidate, no sign of that yet, I’ll probably vote for one of those two (probably a lesser of two evils vote again).
[2015-09-28 14:54:45] <Emmy B> Very interesting, frustratingly I cannot vote where I live in National elections only local and London Mayor but Corbyn’s ideas are so refreshing to hear.

[2015-09-30 16:50:12] <M> Oh FYI, I think that was the wrong 60 Mins interview. That one is Australia 2013, this one is US 2011: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzC9invn4Ko

[2015-09-30 16:54:12] <WikiLeaks> That Mills email is [barf].
[2015-09-30 16:57:42] <M> The “leadership” one isn’t from Mills. She was cc’d on it. The author is redacted.
[2015-09-30 16:57:44] <voidiss> Indeed! Ass-licking over and over.
[2015-09-30 17:03:08] <WikiLeaks> You’re right.
[2015-09-30 17:03:42] <WikiLeaks> So we must speculate who is the H arse licker.
[2015-09-30 17:04:03] <WikiLeaks> If any of our staff tried that we’d fire them immediately.
[2015-09-30 17:08:25] <M> Only thing they’re good for is ego-boosting.
[2015-09-30 17:10:05] <WikiLeaks> It’s manipulative and not sound advice.
[2015-09-30 17:12:11] <voidiss> It adds to the State Department’s “religious tendency”.

[2015-09-30 17:12:55] <M> I think FUBAR was more what Hillary needed to hear.
[2015-09-30 17:18:07] <WikiLeaks> It’s amusing that she’d never heard the phrase before even through the Monica 90s.
[2015-09-30 17:18:31] <WikiLeaks> WikiLeaks took Hillary’s FUBAR virginity.
[2015-09-30 17:29:56] <voidiss> LOL. A well-deserved taking, she will never forget it again.
[2015-10-01 05:13:58] <LibertarianLibrarian> LOL. Thanks Emmy for the advice. Interesting H emails. It’s not like she needs her ego enlarged, but certain types of people like to kowtow to authority to get privileges in return.
[2015-10-01 05:15:19] <LibertarianLibrarian> Not surprising H tried to manipulate the media. Probably works more often than not. Sadly.
[2015-10-01 05:39:33] <Emmy B> Agree Jenny! personally I would love a lady in the top job but HC is a great disappointment. I can hardly assess Democratic domestic policies (other than what NSA has been up to) as I do not follow politics in the US much but US foreign policy has been one and the same like the Republicans so truly abhorrent.
[2015-10-01 05:54:43] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, we need a high quality female candidate. Voting someone in just b/c of gender would be just as problematic as voting Obama in b/c of his skin color. Obama has been a disaster and I warned my family & friends he would be but everyone felt good about voting for a black President without considering whether he’d be a GOOD President.
[2015-10-01 05:59:14] <LibertarianLibrarian> These days, there really isn’t as much of a difference b/w the Democrats and the Republicans as they and the media would like you to believe. They squabble over things, usually to no useful end, but actually, they pretty much end up doing the same thing. Given the diversity of this country and the corruption in the two parties, any candidate who hopes to win either has to run on nebulous ‘change’ as Obama did or they wash themselves out to mean nothing and everything. Some day we’ll see someone take strong stances and get elected, I hope – I’m suspecting Bernie Sanders could be a contender, much as Ron Paul was. The issue is winning in the end, but the power, media, and money against such candidates is tough to beat.
[2015-10-01 06:03:04] <LibertarianLibrarian> Much of the problem is the corruption of the mass media. And the reliance of campaigns on how much money they can spend. I, personally, think that there should be limits on how much anyone or any group, whether ‘non-profit’ or ‘profit’ can contribute, and limits on how much candidates can spend. Particularly the latter. We should set a definite limit to campaign spending and apply it to all candidates equally. I’m beginning to think we should also ban media organizations from endorsing candidates.
[2015-10-01 06:05:35] <LibertarianLibrarian> The last may not be constitutional but we need some way to curtail corrupt mass media from influencing people’s votes. Not sure if there’s a way around that one.

[2015-10-01 14:04:32] <M> Haha. CBS has responded to accusation of 60 Mins “planting” questions by saying Crowley was just trying to suck up to Hillary:
“The idea of a ‘plant’ is as preposterous as this email writer’s attempt to get credit from his boss. We spoke to many sources for this story.”

[2015-10-01 14:22:03] <voidiss> LOL. It would be funny if now Crowley came out with another response claiming CBS is a bunch of liars who did planted questions to suck up to State Department.
[2015-10-01 14:24:56] <M> Crowley has responded. “We offered our perspective to ’60 Minutes’ on the issue and our perspective wasn’t necessarily unique and, sure, probably some of that was reflected in the questions that Steve Kroft asked… I didn’t need to talk myself up to Hillary. If I said that in an e-mail, then I probably suggested some lines of inquiry and if some of that bore fruit, then fine, great.” https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/10/01/60-minutes-denies-state-department-planted-assange-questions-but-shows-interview-should-raise-eyebrows/
[2015-10-01 14:38:09] <voidiss> Well, predictable answer, he doesn’t expose himself either on one side or the other, he doesn’t say either “no they didn’t plant anything” or “yes they did plant”.

[2015-10-02 03:18:15] <voidiss> 1) Sweden govt acted illegally and this is known also thanks to WL, so this may be the reason of Assange case.
[2015-10-02 03:18:31] <voidiss> 2) This collaboration may be used to back NATO membership.
[2015-10-02 03:18:45] <voidiss> 3) Sweden is now presented as HR champion with refugees but have responsibilities for Afghan ones.

[2015-10-02 08:34:30] <voidiss> An article about Sweden’s role in Syria. It funds the Syrian Coalition which has connections with Al-Qaeda and “is complicit in crimes at least as serious as those the Swedish government accuse the Syrian government of”. Again, Sweden may not be the “biggest villain” (as Turkey, Qatar, US etc), but it’s complicit http://www.globalresearch.ca/swedish-foreign-aid-to-allies-of-al-qaeda/5475724
[2015-10-02 08:40:20] <WikiLeaks> Our pet conspiracy theory is that it is taking Syrian refugees as its contribution to the US war effort. It admitted to doing that in cables in relation to Iraq.
[2015-10-02 08:41:46] <WikiLeaks> For Syria, pumping out the Syrian middle class to Sweden and Germany, i.e all the engineers and bureaucrats, will cause the government to eventually collapse.
[2015-10-02 09:01:30] <voidiss> Following this theory, do you think that also other EU countries’ decision to take in many refugees (like Germany, for example) could have been prompted by US as a war strategy against Syrian government?
[2015-10-02 09:04:27] <WikiLeaks> Germany is possible. It is deeply involved with US military structures though we hear there’s also a desire by German industrialists to lower wages. Could also be smart strategy to get the “best” refugees first, rather than having to deal with the floor of poor and esperate that will come later.
[2015-10-02 09:04:50] <WikiLeaks> floor=flood
[2015-10-02 09:20:48] <voidiss> Well, the first hypothesis would explain why Germany stated it will welcome only war-zone i.e. Syrian refugees and instead leave out Balkan ones: http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-10-01/germany-expel-european-migrants-make-room-syrian-refugees

[2015-10-02 09:55:15] <voidiss> The article speculates that Obama actually doesn’t want “regime change” in Syria.. but also Hillary emails show that likely this isn’t true.

[2015-10-03 08:53:16] <M> JA referred to as “autistic, megalomaniac sex creep” in Jonathan Franzen’s new book Purity. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGIrNN0k7iU
[2015-10-03 09:55:59] <WikiLeaks> JA or JA’s character in the book?
[2015-10-03 10:06:04] <M> JA.
[2015-10-03 10:06:23] <M> Let me get exact quote from video.
[2015-10-03 10:10:25] <voidiss> Here is an excerpt from the book, I think: https://books.google.it/books?id=cT94BwAAQBAJ&pg=PT453&lpg=PT453&dq=assange+%22autistic,+megalomaniac+sex+creep%22+Franzen+Purity&source=bl&ots=R2cZioR-ni&sig=4l48H0KsDycdLa_hEphFDG1h2tw&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAmoVChMInuflqeOmyAIVTLoUCh2ZRQc-#v=onepage&q=assange%20%22autistic%2C%20megalomaniac%20sex%20creep%22%20Franzen%20Purity&f=false
[2015-10-03 10:11:05] <M> Q: “It may be professional jealousy on his part, but he (referring to Andreas, major char in book) refers to Assange as that autistic, megalomaniac sex creep.”
Franzen: “Yes.”
Q: “You don’t mince your words… I mean, not suggesting that you said think that.”
[2015-10-03 10:11:48] <M> And then Franzen says how it’s a sort-of rivalry thing (between JA-esque character and JA).
[2015-10-03 10:33:42] <M> Complete e-book: https://thepiratebay.gd/torrent/12385674/Purity_-_Jonathan_Franzen.epub
[2015-10-03 10:37:05] <M> The book again says “Creepy sex stuff had already tarred Assange’s reputation.”, though this is not a character quote/thought, just narration.
[2015-10-03 10:37:52] <M> “I do read the newspaper, pussycat. This is the group that the sex criminal started.”
“No, you see?” Pip said. “You see? You’re thinking of Wikileaks. You don’t know anything about the Project. You live in the mountains and you don’t know anything.”
[2015-10-03 10:53:11] <voidiss> “Andreas imagines people googling ‘tad milliken’, seeing the words ‘Andreas Wolf’ and ‘statutory rape’ on the first pages of results, conflating his blondness and his line of work with the unfortunate ortographic proximity of ‘Andreas’ to ‘Assange’.”
[2015-10-03 10:57:55] <voidiss> And further, “from the example of Assange, he’d learned the folly of making messianic claims about his mission” referring to Andreas Wolf, immediately after he’s said to have refused to upload some docs for fear. And WikiLeaks is described in Andreas words as a “neutral and unfiltered platform”.
[2015-10-03 10:58:10] <voidiss> Wow. This book is a full-blown smearing.
[2015-10-03 11:26:00] <WikiLeaks> The author’s father is a Swede.
[2015-10-03 11:29:37] <WikiLeaks> Hard to say. It’s anothe rself-indulgent novelist opportunistically sucking down the zeitgeist.
[2015-10-03 12:09:06] <LibertarianLibrarian> I’ve found myself critiquing or at least questioning anything I read these days that doesn’t offer direct access to evidentiary support. Of course, in fiction you can pretty much say anything. I sure hope get the difference between fiction and fact, as popular media has a huge cultural impact, both reflecting it and influencing it.
[2015-10-03 12:09:06] <LibertarianLibrarian> I sure hope *people* get…

[2015-10-04 08:23:47] <LibertarianLibrarian> Obama has apparently asked for an ‘investigation’ of the attack on the MSF hospital. Some poor scapegoat will be found or it’ll be disappeared once the news moves on. Blah blah. Such a hypocrite!
[2015-10-04 08:57:56] <WikiLeaks> Freemasons are still influential in the UK police.
[2015-10-04 08:59:22] <WikiLeaks> They’re still powerful in Sweden, where they have integrated into the establishment to such an extent that the King is the chief Freemason.
[2015-10-04 09:00:51] <WikiLeaks> You can use ‘|’ for an OR
[2015-10-04 09:02:00] <WikiLeaks> But note that it binds more tightly than space, so: a b|c d searches for: a (b OR c) d, but you can quote: “a b”|”c d”

[2015-10-09 11:56:29] <M> I wish Bernie Sanders would comment on TPP leaks, especially since he’s been staunchly against it for quite some time. But his comments on WL seem to be zilch, and few on Snowden.
[2015-10-09 11:57:16] <Emmy B> well lets
[2015-10-09 11:58:22] <Emmy B> consider what would national sec establishment would do to BS
[2015-10-09 11:58:58] <Emmy B> if he came out with pro WL/Snowden comments…
[2015-10-09 12:02:40] <M> Snowden he’s spoken against the surveillance he revealed, but has reserved comments re Snowden himself. I am curious as to why he hasn’t done the same for TPP releases.
[2015-10-09 12:24:20] <WikiLeaks> Sanders is not great on foreign policy issues.
[2015-10-09 12:26:31] <Emmy B> who advises him? on F

[2015-10-09 12:34:53] <Emmy B> he says some good things ie black lives matter
[2015-10-09 12:39:13] <M> Sanders has a Brooklyn accent.
[2015-10-09 12:43:52] <Emmy B> 🙂 thx – very Holywood
[2015-10-09 15:24:49] <LibertarianLibrarian> There’s some New England in his voice as well as the Brooklyn. Living 51 miles from Brooklyn that accent can really hit you. His is much lessened.
[2015-10-09 15:26:21] <LibertarianLibrarian> I have seriously mixed thoughts on Sanders. As WL said, his foreign policy isn’t great, what there is of it. And I, too, am waiting for him to take a stand on surveillance and whistleblowers.
[2015-10-09 15:26:55] <LibertarianLibrarian> Keeping his head down on the topic doesn’t sell him to me.
[2015-10-10 10:37:29] <voidiss> Still no news from Sweden-Ecuador talks… I’m starting to worry, what are they doing?
[2015-10-10 10:45:00] <Emmy B> I saw an article in spanish…

[2015-10-11 09:45:37] <Emmy B> How wrong the world is when truth is distorted by entrenched interests and how ignorant this young lady sounds.
[2015-10-11 09:46:17] <WikiLeaks> Would be helpful if people could correct the errors in that “refused to stand trial” etc.
[2015-10-11 09:47:05] <Emmy B> Already we populated the hashtags with facts, we’ll continue.
[2015-10-11 09:48:40] <Emmy B> For those who do not know please note:
[2015-10-11 09:49:16] <Emmy B> quote: “then the attempt to host this man in the same term as a Consent Forum designed to look at the hostility surrounding those brave enough to step forward and speak out, is worth bearing in mind” unquote
[2015-10-11 09:49:40] <Emmy B> The Consent Forum is outlined here:
[2015-10-11 09:50:04] <Emmy B> https://www.facebook.com/events/519301754903641/
[2015-10-11 09:50:54] <Emmy B> within those to attend is Queer Strike, a years long supporter of Julian Assange WikiLeaks and Chelsea Mannning
[2015-10-11 09:51:49] <Emmy B> See Queer Strike FB page confirming attendance of the event here: https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=987704451290756&id=337135763014298
[2015-10-11 09:53:13] <Emmy B> Queer Strike have from the beginning supported Julian Assange together with PayDay Network and Women Against Rape. All three organisations continue to support in word and deed and with their feet in the various vigils JA WL and Chelsea Manning
[2015-10-11 09:53:37] <Emmy B> Other attendants of the Consent Forum
[2015-10-11 09:55:44] <M> Justice 4 Assange posted a fact-checker specifically for the issue, which can be used when responding to the errors: https://justice4assange.com/Cambridge-Union-Statement-Fact.html
[2015-10-11 09:56:34] <Emmy B> like the ‘All African Women’s Group’ have marched in defence of WikiLeaks Chelsea Manning and in support of Edna’s Law at London Pride, please see here their banners at the Facebook banner page of Queer strike from this year’s London Pride in June
[2015-10-11 09:56:39] <Emmy B> https://www.facebook.com/Queer-Strike-337135763014298/timeline/
[2015-10-11 09:57:08] <WikiLeaks> 4 union officers have resigned, including the women’s officer. Though it seems the other resignations may be unconnected, the media won’t say that.
[2015-10-11 09:57:39] <Emmy B> One of the organisers Didi specifically asked me to include Julian Assange in the chants during the march they are definitely ‘on our side’
[2015-10-11 09:57:47] <WikiLeaks> Frankly, it’s likely the resignation ofHellen Dallas was opportunistic as well.
[2015-10-11 09:58:30] <WikiLeaks> But the referendum may be an opportunity to educate.
[2015-10-11 10:00:18] <Emmy B> I have twitted at Silky Carlo a Cambridge Alumni about it, not sure if she picks up Twitter notifications, I see if I still have her e-mail address to let her know about what is going on… she is a super lady.
[2015-10-11 10:00:18] <voidiss> I think it was opportunistic too. The other members tried to find a ‘balance’ with proposing her to ask the firs question etc etc, and if her aim was simply to highlight her point of view of the matter she would have accepted. Instead she went on with the most radical action, resigning, to make the point that “look at what Assange is doing to our community”.
[2015-10-11 10:01:14] <Emmy B> Certainly an opportunity to educate but who is going to do it as this is only open to members and alumni
[2015-10-11 10:01:28] <Emmy B> so much bias in UK press
[2015-10-11 10:04:39] <Emmy B> [Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/653254900244217859/653254900265132033/5dXmddCd.png
[2015-10-11 10:06:18] <Emmy B> A photo is worth a thousand words, here we are at London Pride and you can see two of the organisations attending the Consent Forum are in support of WL, JA and all whistleblowers.
[2015-10-11 10:07:12] <Emmy B> You can see one of the Pink placards on Chelsea’s banner mentioning Assange and he was included in all our chants
[2015-10-11 10:07:47] <voidiss> Oh, yes, Did was at the ‘Holy Trinity Of Whistleblowers’ play!
[2015-10-11 10:07:53] <voidiss> *Didi
[2015-10-11 10:09:07] <voidiss> Anyway, I know a guy who studied at Cambridge and has just finished last year. I have contacted him, maybe he knows someone who could bring some actual facts in there, instead of all these smearings and libels.
[2015-10-11 10:09:19] <Emmy B> Exactly Greta you met her yourself, Queer Strike as a collective as well as PayDay Network with whom they work closely support WL/JA. Charlie Chorley certainly does not represent the Consent Forum attendees and does not speak in their name.
[2015-10-11 10:13:19] <Emmy B> I shall contact Silky and Didi, in the meanwhile we put facts out there and let them boil in their own juices. I will be very much surprised if Queer strike and PayDay don’t issue statements as well as Women Against Rape, their representative came outside the Embassy on 4th of April in support of JA and later during an Edna’s Law meeting in Westminster repeated their support I doubt they will walk away now. xxx We keep going 🙂
[2015-10-11 10:16:10] <voidiss> Yes, Didi even sent me an email in which she explicitly said “we work with Payday to support Assange, Chelsea Manning and other whistleblowers”. Clearer than this is impossible! Let’s wait for their statement.
[2015-10-11 10:22:23] <Emmy B> We have to let them do their stuff and not interfere in public I will alert them since Ms Chorley is mentioning the Consent Forum in her statement.
[2015-10-11 10:23:12] <Emmy B> But Once more, the women Against rape statement would be good to add to the hashtag Greta, you know which one I mean?
[2015-10-11 10:25:56] <WikiLeaks> Ha: http://rixstep.com/2/1/20151010,00.shtml
[2015-10-11 10:26:09] <voidiss> Yes, this one: http://womenagainstrape.net/inthemedia/we-are-women-against-rape-we-do-not-want-julian-as
[2015-10-11 10:28:45] <voidiss> That “Josh2” comment is great. But the best phrase is: “Somebody could already today accuse Oliver and/or Gareth of sticking their private parts in the mouth of a dead pig, and turn it into a charge.” LOL
[2015-10-11 10:34:09] <Emmy B> yes that’s it Greta! well found. Also see whether there are any more recent affirmations quoted, I know they stand by that original article but let’s see if we can find something more recent.
[2015-10-11 10:35:27] <voidiss> I’ll search!
[2015-10-11 10:38:18] <Emmy B> Rix is as usual quick and spot on, always a pleasure to read:-) but a personal attack on Mosley via his fascist ancestor attaching it to the hashtag is not fair and weakens his position in this effort. Corbyn was attacked similarly with the cruelty of his workhouse master ancestor… not fair
[2015-10-11 10:40:36] <voidiss> Yes, on that point I disagree, I haven’t retweeted his tweets about that. But this article isn’t focused on that, and it makes some important points, so maybe it’s worth using it anyway…
[2015-10-11 10:41:53] <Emmy B> I have shared the article and will do again, I think he got a bit over excited hehehe
[2015-10-11 10:43:43] <voidiss> Oh, well, likely. And I can understand him — all this shit is definitely absurd.
[2015-10-11 10:43:57] <Emmy B> poor Mosley junior really having such an ancestor and if you check his timeline he professes to support Labour although cannot help himself and border the politically incorrect himself…wait for it:
[2015-10-11 10:44:38] <WikiLeaks> Mosley is much more problematic elsewhere. He worked for the deputy minister of justice 2010-2012, is a tory, pals with mensch, and went to eton.
[2015-10-11 10:45:31] <WikiLeaks> But he’s likely anti-feminist.
[2015-10-11 10:45:59] <Emmy B> *cough cough* perhaps: https://archive.is/LycTr
[2015-10-11 10:48:07] <WikiLeaks> #ThanksSNP is surely satire.
[2015-10-11 10:51:02] <M> I think it’s a riff on the “Thanks, Obama” meme. http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/thanks-obama
[2015-10-11 10:54:13] <Emmy B> Well being Greek a lot of the Anglosaxon humour is lost to me. But here the object of his satire is a young woman as old as he is with a first class degree and the youngest MP. Yes she is tweeting about pasta. Mosley defines who Black is by her sex ‘the woman’ is just above ‘her indoors’ in my book, and her simple tweet. Whilst her predecessor is defined by the status of the office he held ‘Secretary of the Treasury’. It is very telling of what he aspires, but what about the reference to racisim? I don’t get the joke there at all.
[2015-10-11 10:55:49] <Emmy B> Is it because of her name being Black? no idea
[2015-10-11 10:57:33] <voidiss> Oh, well. About his sexism, this can make the point, I think: https://twitter.com/OliverMosley/status/606449237384007682

[2015-10-12 04:20:53] <Emmy B> Telegraph has added an online poll ‘should Assange speak?’ currently 4 votes casted 25% Yes 75% no
[2015-10-12 04:26:32] <Emmy B> spoke too soon, the telegraph added just two sentences from the justice4assange press statement: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11926196/Cambridge-Union-in-turmoil-over-Julian-Assange-invite.html

[2015-10-12 06:17:49] <voidiss> Oh my god. The MET police has decided to leave the physical siege at the Embassy. Oh. My. God. http://news.met.police.uk/news/covert-plan-at-ecuadorian-embassy-strengthened-after-removing-dedicated-guards-132799?utm_campaign=send_list&utm_medium=email&utm_source=sendgrid
[2015-10-12 06:18:39] <voidiss> They continue the operation tonarrest JA if he goes out the Embassy, but not with physical presence of police officers.
[2015-10-12 06:19:09] <voidiss> Anyway, of course: “The MPS will not discuss what form its continuing operation will take or the resourcing implications surrounding it.”
[2015-10-12 06:19:50] <Emmy B> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/asterixofficiel/status/653497877172391936 And more good news: hahaha
[2015-10-12 06:20:51] <LibertarianLibrarian> They took long enough to do that, it’s been unproportionate for years, but still fantastic news! Of course, they’ll have surveillance everywhere. Still, glad to see Met finally found some better use for all those officers. Bet it was a budget issue.
[2015-10-12 06:27:10] <voidiss> I would really like to know what other they have in plan to keep the operation going. We know they would have never let the siege go without having a solid alternative, so now they must feel “strong” enough to do so. And I’m wondering what tools they have. Also, I’m wondering if it isn’t a strategy to weaken the pressure JA case could put on various governments/courts with the proportionality issue. But anyway, these are good news, finally it has happened!
[2015-10-12 06:30:22] <Emmy B> Personally I am very happy about this, we can return in putting posters Up on the railings without the police taking them down immediately and have a more pleasant vigil. Still, the embassy security must remain strong. I wonder whether we will soon hear from the UNWG on Arbitrary Detention and maybe this had to do something with it. Jenny Jones though have been consistent in raising this issue again and again with the Mayor of London and at London Assembly. her last enquiry:

[2015-10-14 03:06:47] <voidiss> I haven’t understood if the initial complaint (merely related to MPs’ comms) was indirectly implying that everyone else’s comms
[2015-10-14 03:07:00] <voidiss> actually should be surveilled but only MPs’ shouldn’t. Because if it’s like that, those two MPs who complained first are utter hypocrites.
[2015-10-14 03:07:10] <voidiss> But apart from that… I have a feeling that the major GCHQ effort will be directed at Corbyn.
[2015-10-14 03:41:14] <WikiLeaks> Marcello is great, but his article is terrible.
[2015-10-14 03:42:25] <WikiLeaks> It is clear he knows very little about asylum law. If his proposals were followed they would have the opposite effect to what he intends.
[2015-10-14 06:37:10] <Emmy B> @ WL 🙂 Marcello is great, he is consistently well meaning and genuine. I like his article because he attempts to address a matter so toxic with a wide range of ideological/political/emotional layers (I wouldn’t even attempt to map them out here in this conversation) that most other shy away from. I remember in history we mapped out migration moves into the Greek peninsula as the landmarks of one historic period moving into another, moving from Stone Age and pre-history to the times of Writing …Then came the Achaeans with weapons of tin, then came The Ionians with weapons of Copper…Then came the Dorians with weapons of Iron… We forget how natural migration as well as mass migration is in our development. 🙂
[2015-10-14 06:39:46] <Emmy B> @ H, couldn’t quite believe what I was reading in that article but then Self-flagellation is very much accepted in certain cultures albeit in a religious context, maybe it is an indication that this lady’s ideology had become something of a religion for her?
[2015-10-14 06:43:43] <Emmy B> hmmm very medieval in its religiosity but protestant in flavour?
[2015-10-14 06:44:00] <Emmy B> what a maze
[2015-10-14 06:52:17] <Emmy B> I just don’t get how equal rights for women need to be so separate from ‘equal rights for all’ (as often the Proffessor professors). Indeed it is a very recent branch of HR struggles in the context of millennia of Human culture.
[2015-10-14 06:56:46] <Emmy B> I applaud this struggle as enriching of our society in general liberating the individual in a social and personal context. But I don’t understand such isolanist and naval looking ideas as that article describes. It speaks a kind of psychotic language? Why waste one’s energy in this way instead of let’s say address the many real problems women face around the world still: slavery, mutilation, forced marriages and violence within the context always of HR for all.
[2015-10-14 06:57:50] <Emmy B> but I must dash x
[2015-10-14 07:07:02] <LibertarianLibrarian> I agree with you Emmy, in the end it must always be framed as equal rights for all. I’ve had a long-standing problem with feminism because it tends towards terrible polemics, hatred, and exclusion of those with differing viewpoints and approaches. Real problems must be addressed, but without playing the blame game.
[2015-10-14 07:07:50] <LibertarianLibrarian> It all seems very self-important of her to turn her personal problem with drunk behavior into a news story.
[2015-10-14 07:12:11] <LibertarianLibrarian> I helped the Professor with his asylum rights letter, fixing the English and trying to clean up some of the less clear statements. I am not sure if I agree with him on it all and I questioned him on a couple of things, but he does make some important points about modernizing and better defining asylum rights and processes.

[2015-10-14 08:55:30] <Emmy B> Jenny wonderful you helped him with his english! I thought it was well written <3 Greek society was very much in flux as I was growing up there, huge differences in attitudes btw city and country for example and from social group to social group. In general women had it tough in a patriarchal society (not to ignore that patriarchy limits mens freedom too not just women’s) but my generation had many more opportunities that ever before which went hand in hand with political developments for the better across society. One here in the UK would laugh to read that some occupational insurance funds in Greece would pay out pensions to unmarried women if their father passed away for example but this was a recognition that ‘in those days’ women could not be financially independent through outside paid work. Other provisions like first born boys of a widow or divorced woman would get reduced time in National Service as they were considered head of the family, i.e. financially providing for their mothers and other dependent members… I mean where do you put such arrangements in the grand literature of feminism? Do we have to permeate every aspect of our social being with ideology? Can’t we just ‘be’?
[2015-10-14 09:34:12] <voidiss> It’s saddening, deeply saddening. Once innovative and strong movements such as feminism are turning into a doctrine. Feminism started long ago and it was a wave of change… I remember the suffragettes in ‘900, for example; Alice Paul and women’s right to vote in America. They protested and fight and even were jailed for this, they represented a strong dissent. And now… now feminism is the emobiement of stagnation. It can be used to promote a certain propaganda, to censor and to defend only a close group’s human rights leaving out all the rest to be destroyed: But more than this, it is ‘conquering the term’; I mean, real feminism isn’t that “trigger warning”/”rape culture” crap, but this flawed part of feminism has grown and grown and of course — as every other conservative/reactionary ideology — has got the better of true feminism and crippled it by becoming the widespread conception of the term. Now everyone who wants to make people know that cares about women’s rights and has desire to fight for them, has to define himself/herself feminist, because if you don’t do, you have less credibility in the realm of feminism, but by doing so you’re indirectly endorsing a doctrine which is wrong and obliges you to adapt to it if you don’t want to be left out.
[2015-10-14 09:34:20] <voidiss> And this hyper-sensitivity in colleges, this “microaggression” thing, is slowly building up an environment which should stay in a dystopian book, not in our reality. An environment in which everyone must be always kind to everyone, in which everyone must only express accepted views in a group think system and leave out dissenting/radical opinion. And again, all this just helps to value more well-being instead of free speech – expressed with other words, but it’s the same old contrast of security vs freedom so loved by NSA and every govt. Another symptom of this widespread culture which molds people into living and dissolving into their restricted area of comfort, without daring to go out of it, challenge the order. Family, job, money. If they have this, they are happy and all the rest can die in front of their eyes and they won’t see. And hypocritically they keep saying “ah, this world is shit, I’d like to see it change” but then they do nothing to actually change it. “I would but I can’t”.
[2015-10-14 10:39:12] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/CancilleriaEc/status/654349836100177921 Patino press conference on JA in three hours (9:30pm BST)
[2015-10-14 10:59:49] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, I can remember in college arguing with ‘feminists’ that I had an equal right to choose between a career or staying home and raising kidd and being told I didn’t, that if I chose the latter, I was participating in the patriarchal system, etc. If you don’t accept and parrot their exact ideology, you’re labeled as ‘antifeminist’ which is an insult without real meaning but gets easily thrown at anyone they don’t like. As you say, dissent or alternative ideas are not allowed. The ideology becomes rigid. It also tends towards defining another group as evil by nature not by action, i.e., if you’re male you are automatically bad. This happens often and is why I’ve always hated to identify myself as anything other than an individualist and a humanist. I’ve been supporting Black Lives Matter because the situation is so bad right now, but really, for me, it’s about equal treatment before the law for all. Not special treatment in either direction, but the same. If we should have learned anything from history it is that once rights are stolen from one part of society, the rights of all are at risk and will fall like dominoes.

[2015-10-15 01:05:17] <Bean> WLs for J:
Message from a friend & supporter who has been chatting to a nurse who is also a supporter:
[2015-10-15 01:05:27] <Bean> Concerned that acupuncture may not have been tried – particularly to relieve the immediate pain, but also for longer term benefits.
[2015-10-15 01:05:45] <Bean> Other things that doctor possibly has not considered: orthotic braces, splints, physical therapy, NSAIDS like Advil, nerve stimulator. As well as increased protein and calcium and vitamin D + glucosamine.
[2015-10-15 01:05:55] <Bean> Hope this helps – particularly acupuncture for the pain now.
[2015-10-15 01:18:11] <Emmy B> I have received similar messages of concern and advise, ppl care!
[2015-10-15 01:20:07] <Bean> Indeed 🙂 I can’t speak for other things, but acupuncture for the pain definitely worth a go.
[2015-10-15 01:53:13] <voidiss> Yes, my mum’s a doctor and suggests the same! Especially physiotherapy for more long-term effect, hopefully. I hope he’ll feel better soon.
[2015-10-15 08:29:44] <Emmy B> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/matthew1butcher/status/654610709091864576
[2015-10-15 08:31:23] <voidiss> What the hell. Another Ball’s article, again apparently based on internal Ecuadorian documents: http://www.buzzfeed.com/jamesball/revealed-ecuador-thwarted-deal-between-julian-assange-and-sw#.rdaMyvEQO
[2015-10-15 08:41:05] <Emmy B> I see Ball testifying in a court of law one day over his personal role in persecuting JA. Still, all this could actually work in WL’s favour.
[2015-10-15 08:42:33] <Emmy B> For example, @ Hazelpress might find opportunity for a FOI in Sweden based on the leaked document as well as to quiz for the Expressen journo?
[2015-10-15 08:46:19] <Emmy B> Not to mention this gives the perfect opportunity to Correa to ‘clear out’ internal opposition to protecting JA. The anonymous correspondent for example will be known to the gov. The Ball protects his identity could indicate he is aligned to interests represented by Ball within the Ec. gov?
[2015-10-15 08:47:59] <Emmy B> Anyway, every pitfall offers an opportunity and James Ball article reveals more about those interests, and the fact he represents rather than JA.
[2015-10-15 09:02:11] <voidiss> How can we know that Correa would ‘clear out’ those who said that? How can we know that this isn’t Correa’s thought too? Ball’s article has been done for smearing purpose, yes, it’s very clear, but if those statements are true, how can we know that this isn’t the secret line of the whole Ecuadorian govt? I know that this is precisely Ball’s aim, but if (and only if, since I wouldn’t bet, given that we’re talking about Ball) those documents are true, how can the Ecuadorian govt be trusted anymore? I mean, that Alexis Mera is the legal secretary. I don’t know, I’m quite scared and I don’t know what to think. I mean, we have always known that Ecuador doesn’t agree with WikiLeaks but simply grants JA asylum because of the threats to his human rights, but I would have never imagined they could say something like: “If he fights with us, we will fire him off to jail in Sweden.” But maybe it’s simply Ball who has built up everything just to spread mistrust.
[2015-10-15 09:02:15] <voidiss> Anyway, the FOI idea would be interesting!
[2015-10-15 09:03:06] <Emmy B> My Dear Greta, this is politics, do not fret.
[2015-10-15 09:03:38] <Emmy B> Ball’s article will be more helpful than he thinks 🙂
[2015-10-15 09:04:21] <Emmy B> If I am very mistaken, it will prompt Marianne Ny to make another statement. The more she talks the better 🙂
[2015-10-15 09:05:18] <Emmy B> It is also embarassing to the Swedish Justice ministry. None of these details are new.
[2015-10-15 09:05:53] <Emmy B> But Sweden now knows that its correspondence is also beein leaked. This is a good thing.
[2015-10-15 09:07:43] <Emmy B> The question to ask Ball if you want is, whether he has cross checked with the Swedish Prosecution or Swedish Ministry that the Swedish docs are genuine. Or whether he has contacted them for a comment.
[2015-10-15 09:10:36] <Emmy B> As I read he has not. Why not. Also, has he contacted the UK correspondent of the Swedes again for verification.
[2015-10-15 09:12:21] <Emmy B> The document’s dates corroborates what I read at the time that Sweden acted in a sloppy and political manner uninterested in real progress.
[2015-10-15 09:18:43] <voidiss> Yes, worth asking him these things, you’re right — and if he hasn’t contacted anyone from Sweden, how he has verified that the documents are true, if he has. Also, it’s worth noting that he always puts only the beginning of the “leaked docs” in the article, for example just a little bit of the Ny email. Why doesn’t he put it in complete form? Is there something in the rest of email that doesn’t play his game?
[2015-10-15 09:24:30] <Emmy B> I bet you this article has Marianne Ny sweating, what other of her correspondence will become public?
[2015-10-15 09:28:00] <Emmy B> I love how he included in the screenshot the Swedish Ministry’s correspondence reference number, so helpful for any FOI 🙂 and the date, the date!!!! five weeks before the statue of limitation been reached. Not very efficient, are they?
[2015-10-15 09:29:46] <Emmy B> Plus, a FOI can ask for the serial documents before and after to see any relating correspondence with other departments before or after this particular one.
[2015-10-15 09:32:41] <Emmy B> extremely interesting how the Ny e-mail has the middle name in CC blanked out but let the other two Ingrid and Karin visible. Hmmm something comes to mind… let me check…
[2015-10-15 09:37:56] <Emmy B> see here: http://rixstep.com/2/20151012,00.shtml
[2015-10-15 09:38:27] <Emmy B> [Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/654697858944241667/654697859225292800/l8I6H_Ky.png
[2015-10-15 09:39:24] <WikiLeaks> JA MRI story is not appearing in Swedish media, of course. Never underestimate the ability of that culture to ‘play the Swede’.
[2015-10-15 09:40:34] <Emmy B> If cecilia was the name that was redacted why was it redacted?
[2015-10-15 09:41:54] <Emmy B> @ WL yes but it will be eventually, neutralised when it is no longer ‘the news’.
[2015-10-15 09:44:04] <Emmy B> Hope JA finds comfort for his shoulder. If it is muscle pain, maybe heat patches might help.
[2015-10-15 09:46:55] <Emmy B> Was June the 8th the very first time Ny contacted the Embassy? and only after Nicola Yang suggested it? how embarrassing!
[2015-10-15 09:47:40] <voidiss> Wait! Regarding the Ny’s e-mail we still know nothing, but now that I’ve checked, about the Swedish Ministry doc there’s no need for a FOIA, we already have the correspondence of that period and even Ecuador’s response (which is in Swedish, however) to that precise statement: http://filebin.ca/2Bf3xwK4Rkho/Appendix2.pdf
[2015-10-15 10:01:09] <voidiss> Re MRI, yes… Swedish media are showing their nature once more, censorship over censorship. There’s only The Local Sweden: http://www.thelocal.se/20151015/ecuador-grant-julian-assange-safe-passage
[2015-10-15 10:08:13] <Emmy B> Thanks Greta, a lot to go through though, will take time to read.
[2015-10-15 10:09:04] <Emmy B> So, why does Ball recycle all this stuff?
[2015-10-15 10:12:57] <voidiss> These come from a FOIA, anyone can obtain them, so I don’t know, probably he simply used them to corroborate and put more ‘substance’ in its article. He uses only a selected part of them, only the Swedish Ministry statement, without including Ecuador’s response or further correspondence, so probably he just needed that bit to play his game, his “Ecuador stalled the proceedings” line.
[2015-10-15 10:20:24] <Bean> WL did you get that message earlier re acupuncture etc?
[2015-10-15 10:37:03] <M> @WL – TT picked up MRI story and it got published in SvD. Yesterday, I think. http://www.svd.se/ingen-fri-lejd-for-assange
[2015-10-15 13:49:28] <LibertarianLibrarian> I hope JA feels better soon! They should be able to bring in portable x-ray and ultrasound machines. Not as good as MRI for soft tissues but definitely a start to rule things out.
[2015-10-15 13:51:43] <LibertarianLibrarian> For anything musklculoskeletal, rest, ice, compression, elevation (RICE) with anti-inflammatory meds is the starting place. It would be awful if he does need surgery. Maybe that will finally push the issue on Sweden and the UK.
[2015-10-15 13:53:19] <LibertarianLibrarian> Ball is an ass. I know it is.good to keep track of him, like some others, but those people’s tweets make me feel dirty just reading them.

[2015-10-15 23:07:49] <Emmy B> Archived timeline here https://archive.is/8ICWW
[2015-10-15 23:23:42] <Emmy B> Please take a look at this: http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2015/10/15/433549/WikiLeaks-founder-Julian-Assange–Scott-Bennet-US-UK
[2015-10-15 23:38:01] <M> Jackie Ashley, journalist and president of the all-female Cambridge constituent college Lucy Cavendish, has welcomed JA speaking at Cambridge. “I think it’s very hard to stop Assange coming to the union, you can’t stop free speech. Free speech is free speech, if people want to protest you just have to let them protest, and I’m sure they will.” http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/t-stop-Julian-Assange-speaking-Cambridge-Union/story-27992785-detail/story.html
[2015-10-16 01:40:03] <Emmy B> hm am I going to back my bags for Cambridge?
[2015-10-16 01:43:07] <Emmy B> *pack* 🙂
[2015-10-16 01:48:42] <Emmy B> if they vote JA to speak (and he is still alive to give it xx) *my attempt to humour* they might protest outside the Union which gives us a perfect opportunity in sisterly solidarity to educate protesters with literature with the facts of the case and in the name of free speech 🙂
[2015-10-16 02:19:18] <voidiss> Educating at the hypothetical protest is a good idea. If only I didn’t live in Italy…
[2015-10-16 02:22:31] <voidiss> (And oh, god, hope that that one isn’t even a remote possibility…)
[2015-10-16 04:08:21] <Bean> @WL There is an excellent (& very kind) acupuncturist from Bristol who would be happy to come and see JA next week. Her availability should be known later today. I will be offline shortly until Sunday evening – but I understand that further contact about this should be coming from Lauri Love.
[2015-10-16 06:10:21] <LibertarianLibrarian> Being there in Cambridge supporting JA if he does speak is an excellent idea. Like Greta, I’m sorry I live so far away or I’d be there. If I could come up with $1K in airfare…

[2015-10-18 09:44:51] <voidiss> Definitely. It’s one of the most stupid smears. After all this time, journalists keep basing their points on O’Hagan’s discredited piece.
[2015-10-18 09:45:18] <M> Generally the case with Times. Plus the paywall keeps it contained.

[2015-10-18 15:57:16] <voidiss> I’ve seen, it’s quite scaring. “You can say what you like but no one will hear you. And also, you’ll think no one cared, so you’ll give up trying.”
[2015-10-18 15:57:19] <voidiss> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/shiromarieke/status/655335689391906818 It seems to be just a part of a sort of crackdown on free expression carried out by Twitter. In fact, there’s also the issue of blocking accounts which connect through Tor browser (it happened to me several times too, twice asking for my phone number to unlock, other times asking for password change).

[2015-10-19 12:31:26] <Emmy B> @dborch follows Mark Klamberg referred to by http://wikiwatch.org.uk
[2015-10-19 12:43:29] <WikiLeaks> Now he’s having a go at Sarah’s speech. However this benefits us as he promotes the speech to is meagre followers, and the speech is excellent.

[2015-10-19 20:07:50] <noll> some great info on Harper in cables, but not much on Trudeau: https://search.wikileaks.org/advanced?q=%22Justin+Trudeau%22&exclude_words=&words_title_only=&words_content_only=&publication_type%5B%5D=3&sort=0#resultshttps://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09OTTAWA795_a.html#efmDASDFG
[2015-10-19 20:52:30] <noll> [Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/656317039955562499/656317039980736512/CiLKbbZI.jpg .. “medical condition”. why the need to redact a paragraph concerning JA’s health? hard to think of a good reason, which makes redaction seem sinister. & where is page two of this email (“1 of 2”)?
[2015-10-19 23:12:52] <noll> Em, CPS email cites: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20537157
[2015-10-19 23:24:34] <noll> another significant redaction, in terms of why redact, is on page 2, where Close is busy helping Ny w/ justifications & PR strategies. from the flow of the email, it looks like that paragraph might detail some defence evidence.
[2015-10-19 23:58:16] <Emmy B> Thank you H! I was tickled by reference to Franfalle (could never spell it) positively a bee in their bonnet xxx
[2015-10-20 00:03:17] <Emmy B> Do you know? I have this creeping suspicion that Paul Close might have been issuing talking points to media via let’s say legal bloggers and ex gov lawyers to ‘make sense of it all’.
[2015-10-20 00:04:32] <Emmy B> reading his e-mails DAG’s blog posts come out screaming…
[2015-10-20 00:04:44] <Emmy B> how is one to know?
[2015-10-20 00:05:50] <Emmy B> Would he have discussed media strategy with Ny? She has certainly answered DAG’s questions this summer which was curious.
[2015-10-20 00:06:41] <Emmy B> Would he have hired a PR co to push out talking points onto the press?
[2015-10-20 00:39:21] <noll> agree re DAG & PC, “zombie facts” published 3 Sep 2012, but they & other interested parties are likely within 3 degrees (or something similar) of each other. speaking of networks – JA isn’t first person to be “in shock” w/ PC’s legal antics: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1304214/Doctor-avoids-criminal-charges-despite-guilty-professional-misconduct-deaths-patients.html
[2015-10-20 01:50:58] <Emmy B> At which stage did Ny decide to issue a EAW? this would be the only way to get the case conveniently into the hands of the Crown Prosecution Service. If Ny had sought MLA to which government department would she have applied here in the UK or even talked to? a FOI could be sent there as well as Sweden in case any correspondence shows whose decision was to have an EAW issued. When did Paul Close offer his advise to not interview? after the EAW was issued or before? Was CPS the body that advised Sweden on issuing an international arrest warrant and getting the content right to suit extradition process requirements to ensure a successful outcome?
[2015-10-20 02:21:10] <Emmy B> On another matter Assange High Court Decision on consent is part of case law: https://archive.is/UpHTVhttps://archive.is/loqok
[2015-10-20 02:53:09] <Emmy B> MGT prepares to present new leak: https://twitter.com/wikileaks_forum/status/656257412438097920
[2015-10-20 03:34:11] <WikiLeaks> CPS has a dedicated PR team, which like all such teams must maintain personal and working relationships with legal commentators
[2015-10-20 03:36:58] <Emmy B> I see, thank you.
[2015-10-20 03:44:41] <Emmy B> I would like to ask, is the identity of the people behind wikiwatch known? in particular the so called ‘objectivisor’ ‘objectiviser’ persona? I looked up the electoral registry for ‘Alan Taylor’ as the address came up on whois of the site as early as 2012, it does show a family of four, the Taylors, living in a 2 bed flat over the course of several years but I am half decided to turn up on the door step and check it out for myself as there is mischief there. No doubt in my mind that currently MGT is handling the twitter account ‘Alan Taylor’. I am asking all this because for some time I have been suspecting DAG or ppl associated with him involved there.
[2015-10-20 03:46:04] <WikiLeaks> They are both basement dwelling troll types.
[2015-10-20 03:46:45] <WikiLeaks> Taylor has been producing fake anti-wikileaks “leaks” and other propaganda since at least 2009.
[2015-10-20 03:48:04] <WikiLeaks> He appears ad claims to have recently retired from the UK MoD.
[2015-10-20 03:48:12] <WikiLeaks> as=and
[2015-10-20 03:48:36] <WikiLeaks> as=ad
[2015-10-20 03:49:44] <WikiLeaks> His motivation is likely a result of his background and because he ran/runs something called “PGP board” and extremely useless WikiLeaks wannabe.
[2015-10-20 03:51:23] <Emmy B> yes, this is what he has told the world about himself but I think this may not quite be a real person. Maybe it is a ‘prop’ a persona. We shall see in the course of the years to come.
[2015-10-20 03:51:56] <WikiLeaks> WL was a threat to both the status mechanisms in his life, and then, there were plenty of our supporters around to “feed the troll” permitting this basement dweller to feel alive in the world.
[2015-10-20 03:52:26] <WikiLeaks> Yes, it’s always possible it is just a prop.
[2015-10-20 03:52:35] <Emmy B> Have you never wondered though that he has never shown his face in the real world?
[2015-10-20 03:52:52] <WikiLeaks> And that ‘PGP board’ was a lame idea of the UK intelligence services.
[2015-10-20 03:54:41] <WikiLeaks> Troll types are sociopaths so they have a paranoic criminal mentality and expect their victims to take revenge one day so are not keen on being identified.
[2015-10-20 03:58:11] <Emmy B> I have archived all wikiwatch and amIObjective URLs on archive.is as well as saved every article as a webpage, Also archived the wikiwatch twitter timeline and some of the objectiviser tweets. Also that persona’s Reddit Q&A and some of the commentary in public on line blogs and newspapers. For a period of six months it was someone’s full time job.
[2015-10-20 03:59:37] <WikiLeaks> Yes. It could have been. Or it could have been someone on a mental or medical pension for six months.
[2015-10-20 04:00:34] <WikiLeaks> Are they still active?
[2015-10-20 04:00:51] <WikiLeaks> We had an idea of making a group for all of them.
[2015-10-20 04:01:16] <WikiLeaks> They’re so toxic they’d turn on each other soon enough.
[2015-10-20 04:05:56] <Emmy B> No, ‘they’ populated MGT’s ‘forum’ from Sep 2012 with posts but in October 2012 MGT took the ‘forum’ off line and when it went back up again it was scrubbed clean of all posts, the main site also went quiet since November 2012.
[2015-10-20 04:07:49] <Emmy B> I am keeping a close eye because they did a lot of damage at the time and helped solidify prejudices and myths, pushing DAG’s articles in every possible social media platform.
[2015-10-20 04:08:35] <Emmy B> Thanks for your feedback!
[2015-10-20 04:16:40] <WikiLeaks> Yes. They were harmful.
[2015-10-20 04:17:58] <WikiLeaks> We get attacked by three groups. 1) establishment professional PR 2) those trying to suck up to the establishment 3) anti-establishment types who consider us an establishment within the anti-establishment sector
[2015-10-20 04:19:14] <WikiLeaks> It is all rather grotesque and does not leave one with a pleasent view of a lot of human nature.
[2015-10-20 04:23:54] <Emmy B> yes
[2015-10-20 04:29:38] <voidiss> Agree with all this. For example, when those people – and WLF guys are expert in this – make jokes on JA situation and suffering one has a really low view of human nature.
[2015-10-20 05:49:43] <Emmy B> Finally! WikiLeaks the musical, love is in the air hahahaha 🙂 http://gapersblock.com/ac/2015/10/19/tapped-a-treasonously-funny-musical-mcl-chicago/
[2015-10-20 05:59:15] <M> Tab poll currently highly in favor of JA speaking at Cambridge (although doesn’t say how many have voted) http://thetab.com/uk/cambridge/2015/10/13/poll-should-the-union-host-julian-assange-58409
[2015-10-20 06:02:06] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/ioerror/status/656450407225511936
[2015-10-20 13:00:08] <WikiLeaks> Hey everyone. Want some fun? The Stockholm Internet “Freedom” Forum is on again.
[2015-10-20 13:00:37] <WikiLeaks> What this really is – a Swedish government marketing/co-opertion exercise.
[2015-10-20 13:01:16] <WikiLeaks> Swedish embassies around the world “nominate” people they think should go. There’s a bias for markets/allies Sweden is trying to break into/make.
[2015-10-20 13:01:42] <WikiLeaks> The thing is funded and run by @SIDA and the ministry of foreign affairs.
[2015-10-20 13:02:58] <Emmy B> ok 🙂
[2015-10-20 13:03:19] <WikiLeaks> @SIDA Is Sweden’s soft-power-bribery agency. It works the same as USAID, buying off different groups with funding.
[2015-10-20 13:03:55] <WikiLeaks> It’s had a lot of influence in the UN and with civil society that way.
[2015-10-20 13:04:43] <WikiLeaks> A few years ago, SIDA’s constitution was changed so it could be used to help prop up Sweden’s wars.
[2015-10-20 13:05:01] <WikiLeaks> i.e by funding war lords around Sweden’s base in Afghanistan.
[2015-10-20 13:05:50] <WikiLeaks> There’s a scene in Mediastan where we interview a Sida person at an Afghan base. Some of oyu may remember it. The woman is lost for words as she’s forced to confront what she’s really doing.
[2015-10-20 13:06:14] <WikiLeaks> Anyway, SIF market’s itself as a “freedom” forum.
[2015-10-20 13:06:46] <WikiLeaks> But it has always refused JA, WL and Snowden.
[2015-10-20 13:06:53] <Emmy B> Mediastan, yes! remember
[2015-10-20 13:06:59] <WikiLeaks> @ioerror used to attend until they worked out that he was sort of WL.
[2015-10-20 13:07:12] <WikiLeaks> When he confronted Carl Bildt about JA.
[2015-10-20 13:07:16] <WikiLeaks> Then never permitted back.
[2015-10-20 13:07:45] <WikiLeaks> We got hold of a blacklist leak in 2014 that had snowden etc on it in an internal email.
[2015-10-20 13:07:54] <Emmy B> They won’t have sweet dimples? @ Jenny!!!!
[2015-10-20 13:08:36] <WikiLeaks> There was a protest there in 2014 among the attendees about the refusal to take WL or Snowden, given that spying etc was the topic and the topic all the time is “internet freedom”.
[2015-10-20 13:08:51] <WikiLeaks> This year, with Bildt gone people thought it might improve.
[2015-10-20 13:10:18] <WikiLeaks> The Topic this year, following, we assume Sweden’s “feminist foreign policy” (although the new FM isn’t too bad, actually in other respects, except russia), the topic is “gender online” in particular “cyber violence”.
[2015-10-20 13:11:57] <WikiLeaks> But if you can make life difficult for them, by educating the attendees who hang out on #SIF15 it will help to continue to drive home the message that Sweden’s anti-WL, anti-Snowden hypocracy has reputation costs and PR manoevers like #SIF15 won’t escape these costs.
[2015-10-20 13:13:28] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/471323265924071425 From last year for background
[2015-10-20 13:13:32] <WikiLeaks> Infact if someone can find the time mark to mediastan to the Afghan-Sida section, then turn that into a #t= link, that could be used to tweet at some of the attendees if SIDA comes up.
[2015-10-20 13:14:07] <WikiLeaks> It will show that WL has exposed SIDA (we did in other respects in the cables too) and that the conflict is institutional also and not just about JA.
[2015-10-20 13:26:26] <voidiss> Oh, how *strange* they’re pushing Cyber Violence as theme this year! If SIDA has had influence and connection with the UN, that VAWG can be easily explained. The two initiatives are connected, maybe.
[2015-10-20 13:26:35] <voidiss> Anyway, good idea, let’s tweet something!
[2015-10-20 13:32:03] <WikiLeaks> UNWomen is almost certainly part funded by SIDA.
[2015-10-20 13:37:03] <Emmy B> [Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/656569843399983107/656569843433480192/t9Oxl3v6.png
[2015-10-20 13:39:34] <Emmy B> The word SIDA is not mentioned in the video but the business credit card clearly shows the interviewee works for them. The section of the video is 31:20 onwards for Northern Afghanistan and starts immediately at the Swedish base in Afghanistan.
[2015-10-20 13:40:08] <Emmy B> I will prepare a few things later on tonight and let’s see what we can use.
[2015-10-20 13:41:17] <WikiLeaks> Additional notes: CRDefenders (civil rights defenders) is maily/wholly funded by SIDA.
[2015-10-20 13:42:39] <WikiLeaks> You can link directly to it if you put &t=31m20s at the end of the Youtube URL.

[2015-10-20 13:55:10] <WikiLeaks> It was also written up, we think, for Aftonbladet by Johas
[2015-10-20 14:37:33] <M> RT on the ban last year: https://www.rt.com/news/162072-wikileaks-internet-forum-sweden/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter
[2015-10-20 14:38:52] <M> Helpful searching on Twitter <from:WikiLeaks sif14> to understand the ban in context of last year.
[2015-10-20 14:40:58] <Emmy B> thanks will do, something to use: http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/01/nsa-whistlebloewer-edward-snowden-wins-swedish-human-rights-award
[2015-10-20 14:56:23] <Emmy B> Sarah Harrison too could have easily participated too having just won this amazing award.
[2015-10-20 16:36:43] <WikiLeaks> Not by the Parliament. Just in the Parliament.
[2015-10-21 00:27:49] <voidiss> Tiernan Douieb on new revelations on JA case: https://www.rt.com/op-edge/319199-uk-wikiLeaks-documents-assange/
[2015-10-21 00:28:15] <voidiss> He comes out with many very unpleasant and stupid comments like “I’ve read Scandinavian prisons are quite comfy as well”
[2015-10-21 00:29:03] <voidiss> (which seems too similar to troll’s jokes like “they offer great medical care in Wandsworth”), but well, maybe it’s satire & I don’t get it.
[2015-10-21 00:29:18] <voidiss> Apart from this, he thinks UK doesn’t want to get rid of JA because he may have info they could use to blackmail Sweden.
[2015-10-21 00:29:40] <voidiss> Which is stupid because WL has never worked in this way.
[2015-10-21 00:34:47] <M> It’s a lame interview. He doesn’t even answer the questions at times. If you check his timeline, you’ll see that he’s been making anti-WL/JA comments for years. I’m not sure why RT chose to interview him, but it can probably be ignored; he has little influence.
[2015-10-21 00:38:56] <voidiss> Thank god, I would be surprised by the contrary. He doesn’t get the situation at all – willfully, as it seems.
[2015-10-21 00:41:40] <voidiss> …Apparently there is a trend among pro-govt/anti-WL people to joke on sending juicy info on WL prosecution on Christmas.

[2015-10-21 02:11:04] <Emmy B> Thanks Greta indeed!. @ WL yep Swedish parliament was only the venue, still it is significant, as many parliamentarians attended.
[2015-10-21 02:15:24] <voidiss> Anyway, people I tweeted to about SIF14 ignored it, or at least none of them answered.
[2015-10-21 07:20:42] <M> WLF, Eckersley are harassing @SMaurizi over latest FOIA docs https://twitter.com/SMaurizi
[2015-10-21 07:26:59] <M> HuffPo has published another anti-JA piece from CUSU woman’s officer. Her argument this time is: ‘JA has already spoken at CUSU therefore he can’t possibly have anything new to say’. https://archive.is/wMC1f

[2015-10-21 10:58:41] <LibertarianLibrarian> A lot happening fast! I’ve been buried with work but it
[2015-10-21 10:59:51] <LibertarianLibrarian> it’s good to see the expose on the UK govt’s culpability in the whole Swedish debacle. I hope JA’s attorneys make them pay!
[2015-10-21 11:00:40] <LibertarianLibrarian> I’m also amused to see that the days of teenage hackers getting into the DOD/CIA/etc. are not over.

[2015-10-21 13:38:27] <Emmy B> The trolls have not picked it up it seems. But maybe members will not turn up to vote in big number. This has never been done before in 200 years. If a result is published I hope we get to know the actual numbers that voted.
[2015-10-21 13:39:40] <Emmy B> @ h Re your FOI, I am shocked. I will forward this with your permission to my next letter to London Assembly. Well due. Thank you for your efforts!

[2015-10-21 13:50:50] <voidiss> This is the evening of abnormal things. First, the Torture email and its wonderful quote “give our intelligence agencies the tools and flexibility they need to conduct interrogations on suspects” that really makes you think those people are likely all sociopaths… And then this FOI response. They have no decency, my god. “Confirming or denying this information is held would damage the trust and relations between UK and other foreign states”. We’re talking about plans to murder, murder!, a man! Agree with Emmy: I am shocked.
[2015-10-21 13:54:14] <Emmy B> the truth will come out, we keep supporting x

[2015-10-21 14:14:17] <M> Brief statement from CIA today:
“The hacking of the Brennan family account is a crime and the Brennan family is the victim,” a CIA spokesman said, adding that the family’s private messages had been “plundered with malicious intent”. He added: “This attack is something that could happen to anyone and should be condemned, not promoted. There is no indication that any the documents released thus far are classified.” ” http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8d79f53c-7830-11e5-933d-efcdc3c11c89.html#axzz3pEtSuh9n

[2015-10-22 02:22:37] <Emmy B> I thought it was a fake story (see earlier message above) I will check Al Jazeera
[2015-10-22 02:25:14] <Emmy B> No I don’t see it there. We have to be careful with the Saudi release and go for reputable newspapers because look at this indicative of Saudi propaganda tactic : http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/06/saudi-arabia-warns-sharing-faked-cables-150621113046947.html

[2015-10-22 14:50:03] <M> More stats. “With a turnout of 1,463 students, 1,125 voted for Assange to speak via videolink, a 76.9 per cent share of the vote. Only 338 Union members voted against the motion.” http://www.varsity.co.uk/news/9067

[2015-10-23 02:13:31] <Emmy B> So let’s ponder for a minute, in many countries around the world child brides and female mutilation reign supreme. How do you engage in changing attitudes and ethics? free speech imperative to bring about positive change. No platforming is a double edge sword, ultimately, it has a fascist aspect to it, in accepting social exclusion, very worrying what we are capable of doing.
[2015-10-23 02:14:49] <Emmy B> At a different level, one may suggest that Marianne Ny and her collaborators have ‘not platformed’ Julian Assange out of the legal process platform.
[2015-10-23 02:16:03] <Emmy B> They have wanted to question him and declaring it to the world by inviting him to be questioned but at the same time they blockade every platform through which he could express his side of the story, prohibiting his free speech.
[2015-10-23 02:20:30] <Emmy B> He was ‘non platformed’ as a written statement, oral statement via phone and video link were were rejected as platforms were his voice could be heard on this matter. Similarly, a person to person interview at the Swedish Embassy here in London, at the Australian Embassy in London, even at the Ecuadorian Embassy in Stockholm, all became unacceptable platforms upon which the free flow of information on these cases could be exchanged.
[2015-10-23 02:23:32] <Emmy B> We have to go back to what Eva Joly said about the tools available in the box that give the opportunity to those who seek justice to create judicial platforms upon which to collect evidence.
[2015-10-23 02:29:07] <Emmy B> Maybe we could make a “Permission to speak” banner and hang it outside the Swedish embassy here in London

[2015-10-23 05:21:07] <Emmy B> JA for 18 months visited police station daily, wouldn’t UK police station be the right ‘platform’ for his side of the story to be heard?
[2015-10-23 05:24:32] <Emmy B> But Swedish Authorities in adherence to UK’s Crown Prosecution Service advise ‘non platform’ JA from all available avenues that could have made his evidence been heard de facto censoring him. The only avenue they left open was the one that would take him straight into a US extradition/rendition.

[2015-10-23 14:11:33] <Emmy B> Excellent JA interview with the Greek journo, Kostas Efimeros. He and his colleague Gerasimos Livitsanos presented the interview in their show with original audio and parallel translation which was very good but missed some bits. Their commentary was good but kept it short as they wanted to broadcast as much of the interview as they could in their one hour radio programme. Very much behind WikiLeaks in their work and very proud to have JA in their show. Did try to get it right regarding JA Swedish case but I very much doubt they knew much of the detail so some of what they said was inaccurate or incomplete, but always trying their best.
[2015-10-23 14:12:33] <Emmy B> They promised to update their site with the audio and transcript in Greek translation as soon as they can and share it on line together with other commentary.

This magazine has devoted pages and pages on WL revelations despite clearly right wing, their editor is a journalist with a right wing agenda (not a fascist though) with the Karamanlis fraction of the party, clearly pissed off at US for their conspiracy against the last Karamanlis government which fell 2009 (see Pythia II) since it was revealed.

[2015-10-29 03:16:30] <voidiss> Regarding BBC issue with the Terrorism Act, this Katz’s statement is outrageous.
[2015-10-29 03:16:57] <voidiss> “While we would not seek to obstruct any police investigation, we are concerned that the use of the Terrorism Act to obtain communication
[2015-10-29 03:17:17] <voidiss> between journalists and sources will make it very difficult for reporters to cover this issue of critical public interest.”
[2015-10-29 03:17:57] <voidiss> It’s an incredible act of ass-licking to the govt. It’s too mild, the situation is severe, wrong & dangerous and he don’t dare challenge it.
[2015-10-29 03:23:24] <voidiss> Not difficult to understand why he took part in the smearing campaign against Julian.
[2015-10-29 03:23:48] <voidiss> However, that statement is dangerous b/c it passes the idea that journos may feel a bit of discomfort, but not be angry & willing to oppose.
[2015-10-29 03:30:25] <Emmy B> During the junta years 1969-1974 in Greece most newspapers continued their operation, self censoring. It was a most brutal dictatorship, thousands tortured as a control, punitive and reformative process, still Greek society continued to function and newspapers continued to operate. Yes there were individual cases of resistance and some efforts for organised revolt in a small scale but nothing in a grand scale. Institutions adjusted their behaviour to the new situation and found ways to turn a blind eye or partly justify their position by quietly acquiescing. In the end the junta imploded from within. It was the army generals who decided to bring a return to democracy. They were dismayed at the junta’s treasonous effort to overthrow unsuccessfully the democratic government of Cyprus, handing Turkey the premeditated ‘way in’ to invade and partition the island. Having committed in effect National Treason of the greatest degree in opening the door to the brutal enemy’s worst plans, some generals and right wing politicians came to an accord, to bring back Karamanlis, restore democracy in return for impunity for the treason, and impunity for most of the junta’s crimes. I bring this as an example to illustrate the sad fact that Democracy and what it means to our society is only as precious as we give it and the value of its currency is only determined by the action we are prepared to take to keep it safe.
[2015-10-29 03:32:51] <Emmy B> Why should we be surprised? a modest life is what most of us aspire to and is reflected in the institutions we make no matter what airs, graces and pretences we put on. Still there are capsizes in history as we live now that individual action has effect. But it won’t come from the top. xxx 🙂

[2015-10-29 11:56:19] <noll> this was July, so why take laptop data now? – kill list fishing – other sources/ contacts, shoring up legal justification for past strikes? anyway, the journalism-kill list connection (be it either inadvertent or deliberate subterfuge) isn’t being covered by journalists.
[2015-10-29 12:26:41] <WISE Up Action> Thanks for pullin that out, H. Wait with bated breath to see which way this goes vis a vis state of British media – will it galvanise some/any into a more serious resolve to do their proper job recognising the urgent need for it….or just increase compliance…?
[2015-10-29 13:22:07] <noll> thanks Action, everything about UK drones & Syria is muddled, policy, legality etc. hopefully CL can generate some clarity. but yep, journalists (incl. ‘journalists’), seem to have a habit of making contact, getting a story, & then finding their sources killed. so, what is coincidental, or inadvertent, & what is deliberate. & in some cases are journalists driving strikes by creating situations (inactions, media exposure) that can harvested for evidence. which came first, the Sun or GCHQ, or both.

[2015-10-29 14:29:44] <voidiss> Their arrogance is incredible, but more than this – as the article highlights – it clearly shows the imperialist nature of their interests, which are linked to globalization and large bodies containing various nations that can be more easily controlled by the emperor-US.
[2015-10-30 01:25:49] <voidiss> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/voidiss/status/659997459830153217
[2015-10-30 01:26:14] <voidiss> This is a great declaration of what transparency and privacy should be, and how people should be allowed to act on their own history.
[2015-10-30 01:27:20] <voidiss> There’s an extremely important reasoning, imo: the thin line between transparency & privacy and how it can be manipulated by govts/comps.
[2015-10-30 01:27:45] <voidiss> Paradoxically, transparency can be used to destroy privacy, because the true meaning of it can be altered and transformed in something like
[2015-10-30 01:28:17] <voidiss> “if we have total transparency, we have no crimes or abuses, we have a better world, so why don’t we apply this to everyone’s lives?
[2015-10-30 01:28:43] <voidiss> If people’s existences are constantly recorded, they will be brought to behave only in a good way and not to do bad actions.”
[2015-10-30 01:29:33] <voidiss> And this kind of absurd, wrong idea could be applied to everything and be easily made acceptable to crowds.
[2015-10-30 01:29:51] <voidiss> This could be the line of action of any Google of the world.
[2015-10-30 01:30:48] <voidiss> And the dangerous thing is that the ‘flawed’ interpretation of transparency is easier to be instilled in people’s mind than real, good one.
[2015-10-30 01:32:40] <voidiss> So yes, it’s important to make distinction b/w “transparency for organizations, privacy for individuals”.
[2015-10-30 01:33:01] <voidiss> Build a sort of definite ‘cultural/philosophical thought’ on this.

[2015-11-02 14:27:38] <Emmy B> I keep an eye mostly on fwlf.

[2015-11-02 14:31:25] <WikiLeaks> These are the worst kind of gutter dwellers. It increases their payment for the paid ones and acts as heroin up the arms of the psychopaths who get off on negative attention.
[2015-11-02 14:31:47] <voidiss> Today there was this frustrating Swede who kept saying l’Espresso docs “say nothing new”, “aren’t newsworthy” and bullshit like that, claiming that Swedish MSM was doing the right thing by not covering them.
[2015-11-02 14:32:28] <WikiLeaks> That wasn’t a troll, just a swede. But there’s always a risk of creating a troll.

[2015-11-02 14:34:38] <voidiss> Yes, he was just a Swede, but it was sad to see once again Swedish groupthink at work.
[2015-11-02 14:34:56] <M> “Risk of creating troll” is a v important point. Over zealous correction can turn ignorance into a grudge.
[2015-11-02 14:36:31] <M> Stuff re The Jester is bothering me. I don’t think anyone should engage with him.
[2015-11-02 14:37:07] <Emmy B> Horrid individual

[2015-11-04 04:43:46] <Emmy B> Alert!
[2015-11-04 04:45:49] <Emmy B> This is how Christine Ann Sands prolific trolling the WikiLeaks/Anonymous cause is used for propaganda against genuine supportive action: http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/616918/Cities-facing-lockdown-Anonymous-protestors-threaten-world-s-biggest-demo-TOMORROW
[2015-11-04 04:46:12] <Emmy B> How many other papers will copy paste this pile of rubbish?
[2015-11-04 04:46:42] <Emmy B> And of course the Ecuadorian Embassy is put into the focus.
[2015-11-04 04:50:19] <Emmy B> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/greekemmy/status/661887990906675200 I have approached the author
[2015-11-04 06:23:50] <voidiss> If the polls are true (and hasn’t changed since February), this is very alarming: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11974835/Actually-British-voters-quite-like-spies-and-snoopers.html
[2015-11-04 06:38:42] <Emmy B> I sent Jon Austin an e-mail informing him the Christine Ann Sands site is fake and other information about her operation and conviction. I am hoping he will take the info down or he might just put the comments I made into his article and make things even worse. Who knows, there is a risk. keeping my fingers cross.
[2015-11-04 06:54:33] <Emmy B> The same misinformation is spread elsewhere: http://www.cityam.com/227964/million-mask-march-police-impose-widespread-restrictions-around-anonymous-protest-amid-fears-of-violence

[2015-11-04 07:29:39] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/YourAnonNews/status/659761929087533056 It’s not just Sands mentioning Ec Embassy re MMM, though. Major anon accounts are as well.
[2015-11-04 07:45:43] <noll> we’re going to do quick storify this evening re Ann Linde’s impartiality/ political ties to JA case.
[2015-11-04 08:09:46] <LibertarianLibrarian> I know I’m behind as usual but… Greta, any US legislation must pass both Senate & House & then be signed by the President. It can get held up at any stage. We can only hope it gets stuck in the Senate.
[2015-11-04 08:12:09] <WikiLeaks> Sands is a problem, but don’t disconnect anon and WL.
[2015-11-04 08:12:24] <Emmy B> @ M interesting how MSM only mention Sands though, next minute they will be pointing to her sofiawilen website… nice! – not and then hey presto SW’s interview on how she is abused by WLsup, Christine Ann Sands already published by UK MSM as a typical WL supporter will do JA no favours. and of course she now has a conviction on a very juicy cause https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8ip1Up2taQ
[2015-11-04 08:12:55] <LibertarianLibrarian> There’s also a likelihood of significant bias in that poll. Without seeing the methodology, we don’t know. But if true, it’s a sad thing that the UK people are buying into the propoganda.
[2015-11-04 08:13:22] <Emmy B> Anon have already warned about her in a video
[2015-11-04 08:13:42] <WikiLeaks> It’s beneficial if it is perceived that anon is protesting aout JA and also, internally within anons who may become sources one day.
[2015-11-04 08:14:22] <LibertarianLibrarian> Unfortunately, the raving lunatics are often preferred by the MSM. More dramatic than rational debate.
[2015-11-04 08:16:01] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, Anon support for WL is valuable. A good thing however Sands and her ilk might want to twist it.
[2015-11-04 08:16:14] <Emmy B> But Sands has nothing to do with Anon from what I have seen and experience. She damages anything she touches.
[2015-11-04 08:16:21] <voidiss> So we simply need to push the fact that anons themselves took distance from Sands and inform that she isn’t representative either of Anonymous movement or WL.
[2015-11-04 08:16:48] <voidiss> (Btw, thanks for the clarification, Jenny!)
[2015-11-04 08:18:53] <WikiLeaks> At this moment all that will do is push anons away from WL.
[2015-11-04 08:19:02] <WISE Up Action> Ffs. What a crock of shit. A veritable cocktail (ha ha) of the Met being utterly disingenuous; srsly taking the piss, the pernicious Public Order Act, the media charlatans, and Sands stirring it wherever she can.
[2015-11-04 08:19:23] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, Greta. As Emmy’s done, we remind people that Sands isn’t representative of WL or WLsup while letting Anon do its own thing. Anon is by nature amorphous but the general support in that ‘community’ for JA and WL is positive.
[2015-11-04 08:19:25] <WikiLeaks> Since it is suggesting that the support for JA is fake.
[2015-11-04 08:21:48] <LibertarianLibrarian> It’s a fine line to tread but we simply have to correct inaccuracies with people who may listen and otherwise treat her as any other troll.
[2015-11-04 08:24:27] <Emmy B> I am out. Jon Austin has just replied that he has amended the article, in fact he has added to the misinformation and even added ‘However, a source close to WikiLeaks said it was a fake website and not connected to Anonymous or WikiLeaks and Mr Assange.’ I have replied that this misrepresents me and he should removed it.
[2015-11-04 08:25:02] <Emmy B> http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/616918/Cities-facing-lockdown-Anonymous-protestors-threaten-world-s-biggest-demo-TOMORROW
[2015-11-04 08:25:18] <M> Media may have picked up Sands’ stuff because of laziness. Since she does have the MMM website, media could’ve assumed it was the official/main site for the protest. It’s easier to do that than try and understand the complexities of anon.
[2015-11-04 08:27:11] <LibertarianLibrarian> What a nuisance, Emmy. Sorry. Have a good afternoon.
[2015-11-04 08:29:57] <Emmy B> Thanks Jenny you too! x

[2015-11-04 14:47:07] <noll> Em, we can ask, but they’re not going to reply to that. but yes, in terms of refusal to adhere to the principle of mutual recognition of asylum, it’s still worth asking. will do. if anyone has FOI ideas pls post here. even the non-answers can be illuminating in various ways.

[2015-11-04 23:31:08] <voidiss> Very interesting thoughts!
[2015-11-04 23:32:38] <voidiss> Also, imho… in both cases these two larger powers publicly pretend to be against the ‘rebel movements’ (ISIS/WLF) but actually they take
[2015-11-04 23:33:16] <voidiss> Also, imho… in both cases these two larger powers publicly pretend to be against the ‘rebel movements’ (ISIS/WLF) but actually they take
[2015-11-04 23:33:37] <voidiss> great advantage from their actions. I mean, I think any govt would apparently take a critical position against trolls who harrass
[2015-11-04 23:33:53] <voidiss> teenage girls or rape victims, but actually WLF’s very useful and even paid by govt; and the same with ISIS, which is regarded as
[2015-11-04 23:34:12] <voidiss> the main current enemy of US -and surely it is an enemy, but US sometimes exploit ISIS actions for their interests
[2015-11-04 23:34:23] <voidiss> (for example, in the cable about overturning Assad regime)

[2015-11-05 01:32:36] <WikiLeaks> mother fuckers
[2015-11-05 01:51:18] <WikiLeaks> We say that because we were releasing more #TPP today.
[2015-11-05 02:54:54] <voidiss> Oh. They knew this and wanted to avoid to be shown up again? Or is it a coincidence?
[2015-11-05 02:57:12] <WikiLeaks> Hard to say.
[2015-11-05 02:57:29] <WikiLeaks> They initially said they were releasing it probably next week.
[2015-11-05 02:58:16] <WikiLeaks> But there were enough partners talking about today over email that they must have known we were releasing today.
[2015-11-05 03:07:26] <voidiss> So now they only have to handle attacks abt content of agreement & not attacks about secrecy, since they released it of their own free will.
[2015-11-05 03:07:31] <voidiss> What a strategy, fuck off.
[2015-11-05 03:33:00] <Emmy B> It is a victory for WL and transparency but too late for democratic processes to fully function in controlling content and process.
[2015-11-05 03:51:55] <Emmy B> The appeal is January/Feb 2016 till MGT convicted FWLF have free hand unhindered, but even after conviction, unless in jail, MGT will not stop. Neither his helpers. We have to see how things unfold over time. The good thing is he can no longer recruit. The good thing is he has exposed himself beyond redemption on the credibility front. Still, ppl like DAG, James Ball, Luisa whatshername who have built careers on smearing JA/WL will always be happy to mutually benefit through shared narative (unless MGT is convicted only then especially DAG may distance finally as he will be tainted by association).
[2015-11-05 03:59:40] <WISE Up Action> Anyone seen / heard of Steinitz recently?

[2015-11-05 07:20:05] <WISE Up Action> Sands’s stuff is spreading on Facebook unfortunately
[2015-11-05 07:23:53] <M> Regarding MMM? It’s already halfway through the 5th, so I’m not sure she can have much influence in that matter (i.e. people have already made their plans for the day).
[2015-11-05 07:24:49] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/freedomgirl2011/status/662287632857227265 It seems she had the opportunity to go on BBC, but it doesn’t sound like she took it.
[2015-11-05 07:44:37] <Emmy B> @£$%^%^&&* 😡
[2015-11-05 08:28:14] <WikiLeaks> Emmy there’s no more developments other han the appeal date is now set?
[2015-11-05 09:53:38] <Emmy B> Cabledrummer will give us an update from his side later on tonight.
[2015-11-05 09:56:23] <Emmy B> Chris has sent a massive twitter complaint about fwlf. Waiting to hear of any result. I have also sent a complaint for 81 fwlf tweets about me but twitter has concluded will not take any action for 60 out of 81. Awaiting to hear for the remainder 21 although I think they will just ignore them so I will have to re-submit.
[2015-11-05 09:58:06] <Emmy B> Bella Magnani has made a police complaint about fwlf twitter account here in the UK because of what they say about her is harassment.
[2015-11-05 10:01:54] <Emmy B> I am wondering if I should do the same (file a police complaint for harassment). My subject access request came back blank, Metpol holds no information about me so MGT’s alleged complaint about me in 2013 has not registered with them or it was all a lie (one more lie?). I will do the same for Essex Police before Christmas as where I live is on the cusp of both services.
[2015-11-05 10:12:58] <Emmy B> Oh great @YourAnonNews tweets Christine Ann Sands map and site and WL re-tweets, ok next time I see her I will roll the red carpet! :-p

[2015-11-05 12:36:40] <M> That map is pretty BS. If you look at the events, a lot of them aren’t actually real. It’s just cities with links to anon groups in the countries. Many link to events with 0 people attending.
[2015-11-05 12:40:26] <M> I think this is a more accurate map of actual events. However, it doesn’t have the propaganda impact of the fake map, so probably won’t be used. http://www.gosur.com/map/?_src=sn-tw&z=3&ll=38.68551,-34.277344&t=roadmap&lang=en

[2015-11-05 14:34:44] <Cabledrum> In the court case of MGT against me regarding his photo, the pronouncement of judgement is postponed until tomorrow.
[2015-11-05 14:35:45] <Cabledrum> Meanwhile, the provider of the forum server, OVH SAS, has been forced by a french court to reveal its customer’s identity.
[2015-11-05 14:35:50] <Cabledrum> According to OVH, the server of FWLF is owned by MGT’s wife, [redacted].
[2015-11-05 14:35:58] <Cabledrum> As a result, the criminal investigations against MGT have been reopened.

[2015-11-06 11:14:20] <Emmy B> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/couragefound/status/662702008504344577
[2015-11-06 11:18:32] <Emmy B> Do you understand that Kiriakou has stated he was the one 17th of November was supposed to kill instead of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Saunders_(British_Army_officer)
[2015-11-06 11:20:21] <Emmy B> The killing of Saunders was what clinched their end as the Greek government decided to bring in the British to help with the investigation. The rest is history https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Organization_17_November
[2015-11-06 11:25:24] <noll> it’s cover somewhere or other in this interview: http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=832&Itemid=74&jumival=1342
[2015-11-06 11:27:17] <Emmy B> But if indeed Kiriakou is right then he was possibly one of the highest ranking CIA officers in Athens.
[2015-11-06 11:28:09] <Emmy B> yes
[2015-11-06 11:29:17] <Emmy B> Obviously I will not discuss the matter further here 🙂
[2015-11-06 13:19:53] <noll> it’s public domain. Kiriakou wasn’t low-level. he said Saunders was deliberately targeted – that he (K) passed over b/c armed in armoured car. others say Saunders wasn’t low-level either & was sole target. on another note, this post-junta disownership is great (a secret US plan to murder US service men, US friendly politicians & anyone Turkish!): http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/texttrans/2006/01/20060120111344atlahtnevel0.3114282.html#axzz3qkCYHUVdhttps://cryptome.org/cia-FM30-31B.htm
[2015-11-06 13:24:45] <noll> lol http://24.wikia.com/wiki/Stephen_Saunders
[2015-11-06 13:28:17] <Emmy B> When I lived in Greece, (I left in ’90) people even then talked about 17th Nov having protectors within the political circles or that it was acting with impunity because it served a purposes. Although not generally accepted as ‘the truth’ about them, the single most damning factor was the fact they were operating for decades without been caught and punished.
[2015-11-06 13:29:25] <Emmy B> Anyone who knows anything about Greece knows about the general incompetence including anyone who wishes to organise crime.
[2015-11-06 13:32:32] <Emmy B> If 17th of November participated in a greater political game outside what it self professed it would be hard to know but the fact they kept at it for so long unpunished leaves many question marks.
[2015-11-06 13:36:04] <Emmy B> My own feeling is that the deep state would have fingers in all kinds of pies. As we now learn for example of the MI5’s role in using surveillance and knowledge of dirty secrets of the worst kind to control IRA leadership for example… how far would that control have to go before we start saying the MI5 used IRA as another Gladio?
[2015-11-06 13:36:29] <Emmy B> It is simply a minefield for the mind

[2015-11-07 05:29:03] <Emmy B> I have just finished my letter to the London Assembly focusing on the L’espresso article and Home office FOI published by Hazelpress
[2015-11-07 05:29:26] <Emmy B> I will enclose both article and Foi with the letter
[2015-11-07 05:35:11] <Emmy B> I am borrowing bits left right and centre to pull the narrative together hoping they read the original articles themselves. I would like to put it in the blog and if you quickly read and make any points in next 30 an hour?
[2015-11-07 05:43:51] <Emmy B> ok will share link here, and we keep it brief, then I de-publish
[2015-11-07 05:48:01] <Emmy B> http://greekemmy.com/2015/11/07/la-nov/
[2015-11-07 05:55:35] <Emmy B> hahahaa I just spotted a spelling error, molding not moulding 😀
[2015-11-07 05:56:40] <noll> Em, you’re repeating a bit. we’d put it something like: New evidence now come to light by Italian Newspaper L’Espresso via Freedom of Information Request directly with the Swedish Ministry of Justice regarding the questioning of Julian Assange. In their issue of October 19th journalist Stefania Maurizi discovered that: “in January 2011, not even two months after Julian Assange had been arrested in London, a lawyer at the Crown Prosecution Service, Mr. Paul Close, strongly advised the Swedish magistrates against questioning the WikiLeaks’ founder in London. According to Close, the appropriate strategy was to interview him “only on his surrender to Sweden and in accordance with Swedish law”.”
[2015-11-07 06:01:33] <Emmy B> how about the bit in bold?
[2015-11-07 06:01:53] <Emmy B> Vaughan smiths comments?
[2015-11-07 06:08:05] <Emmy B> I got the bold bit from Rixstep (just published new article, it quotes directly from the original docs
[2015-11-07 06:09:08] <Emmy B> I must keep it in 2 pages but I am at three so yes I should cut…
[2015-11-07 06:09:20] <noll> so, after Vaughan, we’d go with, “Julian Assange has been granted political asylum.. etc” section.
[2015-11-07 06:14:47] <noll> so, we’d just cut the HP FOI bit & the two polemical paragraphs following, and keep everything from “Julian Assange has been granted political asylum.. etc” it’d then flow/ read much better, esp. to that audience.
[2015-11-07 06:17:21] <Emmy B> HO response indicates they will trade JA’s life and safety for their own objectives, that’s why I want to mention it here as MetPol is supposed to prevent risks to safety for people rather than be complicit in any way even in info gathering
[2015-11-07 06:18:21] <noll> & obviously we’d drop the “in Chief” from “Editor in Chief of WikiLeaks”, this isn’t a telenovela..
[2015-11-07 06:18:37] <Emmy B> hahahah
[2015-11-07 06:18:54] <Emmy B> Korean soap maybe?
[2015-11-07 06:19:11] <Emmy B> *apologies WL x*
[2015-11-07 06:19:52] <Emmy B> true I will simplify and cut
[2015-11-07 06:20:16] <noll> it’s a point with lots of factors that most will dismiss out of hand & in doing so everything else.
[2015-11-07 06:21:21] <Emmy B> thanks for comments H, I will just take a break and re-visit in a bit, want to get it in the post Monday first thing 🙂

[2015-11-07 13:49:57] <Emmy B> happy thought,” the troll wars”
[2015-11-07 13:50:49] <voidiss> Sands seems really crazy. She has no logic at all. She creates disarray even within her fellows.
[2015-11-07 13:52:58] <voidiss> Curiously this comes immediately after the coverage of FOIA’d emails. Not to belittle Stefania’s previous work, she has always done high-risk journalism, but still.
[2015-11-07 13:53:31] <Emmy B> poor thing she seems worried, shame <3, feel for her
[2015-11-07 13:56:12] <Emmy B> Sands can be very amiable and funny, which is very scary when she turns… or you realise what she is really like…spoke to the police for hours upon hours, they loved her, very flirty with them.
[2015-11-07 13:58:56] <Emmy B> the collection of humanity outside the embassy has been amazing over the years, she has certainly printed a chapter.
[2015-11-07 14:00:25] <M> Sounds like Ted Bundy.
[2015-11-07 14:03:31] <Emmy B> I was a little afraid, in particular when press was around she behaved her worst.
[2015-11-07 14:12:33] <Emmy B> not a good bedtime read
[2015-11-07 14:12:52] <WISE Up Action> Em, Sands is back in US now, right?
[2015-11-07 14:14:58] <Emmy B> yes as far as
[2015-11-07 14:15:05] <Emmy B> i know
[2015-11-07 14:15:57] <Emmy B> after her conviction…
[2015-11-07 14:17:30] <Emmy B> Jim rang up a journo friend of his asked him to look up the magistates court record and write up the story so we have something to show ppl about her time here.
[2015-11-07 14:19:55] <Emmy B> As soon as I googled her name up after the first time we met (we welcomed her warmly) I learned about her and warned as many as I could but couldn’t keep up with her
[2015-11-07 14:23:20] <Emmy B> she was infiltrating different groups far and wide and I am very limited with the time I spend in London. She was very determined and some felt intimidated by her, some where charmed, but could not do much with us and became hostile. Particularly towards me and Jim.
[2015-11-07 14:29:08] <Emmy B> what a character, wasting our time really…
[2015-11-07 14:30:04] <WISE Up Action> She appeared out of nowhere on here and tried to connect with us, but asked too many questions from the start. Obviously suspect. Ignored her and she moved on. Hopefully she and MGT can keep each other occupied….
[2015-11-07 14:35:22] <Emmy B> you’d be having a semi normal conversation and suddenly would ask me if I were with the illuminati !!! or something like this
[2015-11-07 14:35:59] <Emmy B> bizarre
[2015-11-07 14:39:10] <Emmy B> and trying to sow discontent and bad feeling, got a phone call from someone “why is this woman badmouthing you and the vigil?” had to spend an hour on the phone re-assuring this person and advised to block her from her facebook page but she was too scared to do so as not to enrage Christine
[2015-11-07 14:39:47] <Emmy B> a very bad apple but of sweet appearance when she wanted
[2015-11-07 14:41:29] <Emmy B> anyway I am out! goodnight everyone 🙂
[2015-11-07 14:47:01] <WISE Up Action> Night, Emmy x

[2015-11-08 07:53:05] <WikiLeaks> We must learn him. Everytime he mentions us anywhere, we push the transcript on the outlet and demand right of reply.
[2015-11-08 08:09:16] <WikiLeaks> Most people think Apple is powerful and innovative, so the unqualified association isn’t all that bad.
[2015-11-08 08:24:44] <M> David Walsh, journalist who exposed Lance Armstrong, makes interesting some comments re Gibney in this video i.e. him failing to do his journalistic duty (@3:12) http://www.heyuguys.com/david-walsh-interview-the-program/
[2015-11-08 08:42:07] <voidiss> I’ve just been to an event in Italy about refugees, and I spoke to a group of activists who organized the No Borders garrison in Ventimiglia
[2015-11-08 08:42:39] <voidiss> (a group of refugees established there on 11 June to protest against the closure of borders, and then some supporters/activists organized
[2015-11-08 08:43:05] <voidiss> a sort of camp – without any permission – which lasted until 30 Sept, then the police forced the dismantling).
[2015-11-08 08:43:22] <voidiss> That camp was a form of civil disobedience, of course, and the activists even documented many abuses of migrants’ hr by
[2015-11-08 08:44:22] <voidiss> police there (when refugees were caught while trying to pass the border they were locked up for more than 6h in a sort of cage, no water).
[2015-11-08 08:44:33] <voidiss> And among the tactics used by media to sully their reputation there was… rape!
[2015-11-08 08:44:40] <voidiss> Some of them were accused of rape, but then the case was closed. It’s interesting to see how the strategies are always the same.
[2015-11-08 09:01:11] <WikiLeaks> Only way to deal with this is to make JA’s case a famous example of false rape
[2015-11-08 09:02:07] <WikiLeaks> i.e rather than JA is innocent, JA is the most famous case of false accusation. It’s a good candidate because the accusation is by the state not the woman
[2015-11-08 09:11:35] <WISE Up Action> Anyone taking the time to look at the record would see that the JA case is unambiguous. The difficulty, as ever, is framing it concisely.
[2015-11-08 09:12:55] <WikiLeaks> 1. already cleared 2. no charges 3. woman says police made it up
[2015-11-08 09:13:41] <WISE Up Action> OK – yes good x
[2015-11-08 09:18:57] <WISE Up Action> Dealing with the monumental and wilful stupidity about US reach is what dominates tho – and the bs about Sweden. Not innocence or guilt.
[2015-11-08 09:20:46] <WikiLeaks> Yes, the US case is what should always come first. But if forced to respond to an attack on Sweden, then those 3 points, inorder to get back to talking about the real case.
[2015-11-08 09:24:45] <WISE Up Action> Understand that. I meant that the British media line which is fed to the populace is that all is simply solved by submitting to ‘Swedish justice’ ho ho.
[2015-11-08 09:30:06] <WISE Up Action> Agree about Gibney, H. Quasi everything. Sentimental, maudlin crap. Potted psychology. Ugh. I thought the clip M shared very telling.
[2015-11-08 09:31:07] <WikiLeaks> Which clip was that?
[2015-11-08 09:31:25] <voidiss> Agree w/ you. The problem isn’t that there aren’t proofs of utter bias, political interference and malicious prosecution in JA case.
[2015-11-08 09:31:37] <WISE Up Action> http://www.heyuguys.com/david-walsh-interview-the-program/
[2015-11-08 09:31:39] <voidiss> The problem is that those proof are kept from common people, who don’t know and don’t care to go searching for them.
[2015-11-08 09:32:07] <voidiss> The available info is the skewed and false one. So we need to spread the true ones, both for JA’s case itself & other possible fake cases.
[2015-11-08 09:32:19] <WISE Up Action> at 3.11
[2015-11-08 09:39:43] <WISE Up Action> Absolutely, Greta. And every detail is worth documenting. And committing to memory in a clear history.
[2015-11-08 09:42:53] <WISE Up Action> As well as that, I think it’s important for us to identify key points (w references) that provide a very concise, digestible summary.
[2015-11-08 09:53:13] <voidiss> Also, another thing that was said in the workshop. Two years ago, an Italian journalist-Lorenzo Bagnoli-did a journey across Europe together
[2015-11-08 09:53:26] <voidiss> with some migrants who wanted to go to Sweden, to document how it really was and why Sweden was so desired as final destination.
[2015-11-08 09:53:44] <voidiss> He said it was because in Sweden the waiting period to have your asylum request analyzed and to receive a place to stay was only 1 month.
[2015-11-08 09:53:55] <voidiss> And ok, well, from a humanitarian point of view this is good, but this can back the hypothesis of the depopulation:
[2015-11-08 09:54:01] <voidiss> Sweden did everything to appear like a sort of heaven to refugees.
[2015-11-08 09:55:53] <voidiss> Anyway, yes, WiseUp! The one that was done for the CUSReferendum is good, it contains those three points WL made.
[2015-11-08 09:58:01] <WikiLeaks> Sweden wants cannon fodder to right the Russians also. Australia had the same policy post WWII, “populate or perish”.
[2015-11-08 09:58:25] <WikiLeaks> right=fight
[2015-11-08 10:09:48] <voidiss> This reminiscences from the Cold War are so stupid.
[2015-11-08 10:26:03] <M> There’s some interesting critiques in this review of Gibney’s Jobs film, too, particularly about interviews he didn’t/couldn’t get. http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenrosenbaum/2015/09/14/why-the-new-steve-jobs-documentary-the-man-in-the-machine-is-unsatisfying/
[2015-11-08 10:26:26] <M> In that film and in WL, he does this whole, “Well, I couldn’t get these interviews, so I guess I’ll make a different film!”
[2015-11-08 10:27:13] <M> Gibney is good at deceiving people that his docs are balanced. But once you’re the subject of one or knowledgeable about the subject, you realize what a bullshitter he is.
[2015-11-08 10:29:02] <M> Going Clear is an interesting one because there’s bullshitters on both sides.
[2015-11-08 10:30:43] <WISE Up Action> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/663421837280415744
[2015-11-08 10:45:50] <WikiLeaks> Heh, Gibney is so easy.
[2015-11-08 11:06:42] <noll> https://twitter.com/hazelpress/status/663431973864624128
[2015-11-08 11:11:23] <WikiLeaks> It’s the sort of clap-trap a baby boomer would eat.
[2015-11-08 11:12:11] <WikiLeaks> But a good outcome. He’s conceeded a lack of objectivity.
[2015-11-08 11:13:20] <M> He has before.
[2015-11-08 11:13:22] <M> “He has no time for “lame arguments” about objectivity, quoting a well-rehearsed line from filmmaker, Werner Herzog: “Objective truth is the phone book, but it doesn’t make for very interesting reading.”
He recognises that all editing is necessarily selective, and suggests documentarians should be judged by standards of “fairness” rather than any mythical objectivity.” http://www.afr.com/lifestyle/arts-and-entertainment/film-and-tv/alex-gibneys-doco-eye-on-the-foibles-of-the-powerful-20150610-ghkyuo
[2015-11-08 11:15:49] <M> It’s basically a catch-all against claims of inaccuracy.
[2015-11-08 11:15:50] <WikiLeaks> objectivity is short-hand for not having a significant pre-conceived agenda, eliding facts the audience would be interested in, or engaging in obvious falsehoods.
[2015-11-08 11:19:07] <noll> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KQSgcAcNpo
[2015-11-08 11:19:11] <M> I can’t find the quote, but I remember Errol Morris saying something about objectivity isn’t about being unbiased, but about recognizing what your bias is and working to counter it.
[2015-11-08 11:27:14] <noll> https://archive.is/nud4q
[2015-11-08 11:30:41] <WISE Up Action> The short Herzog YouTube is excellent, H. The difference between fact and truth.
[2015-11-08 11:33:47] <noll> yep, watch from around 21.45 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlbQF2ht2ic
[2015-11-08 11:35:05] <WISE Up Action> Thx x
[2015-11-08 11:35:21] <noll> – you can see how proud Herzog is that interviewees can sense that he’s completely straight. zero bullshit.
[2015-11-08 11:35:41] <M> Storfiy: https://storify.com/m_cetera/wikileaks
[2015-11-08 11:53:26] <noll> https://www.bu.edu/arion/on-the-absolute-the-sublime-and-ecstatic-truth/
[2015-11-08 12:22:47] <WISE Up Action> Objectivity, Subjectivity, Facts, Truth, Forensic Detail are themselves all subject to the quality/honesty/experience/courage of the particular ‘mind’ channeling them. Gibney is (so far – we must hope for change) shallow, easily-satisfied (lazy, dishonest, prob thinks courage is fending off criticism on twitter), and obv a superficial observer with little experience of people.
[2015-11-08 12:25:51] <WikiLeaks> He’s a coke-snorting former sexploitation producer who found democrats and young interns easier to exploit than prostitutes.
[2015-11-08 12:29:05] <WikiLeaks> Gibney’s pretty obvious. He’s toed a particular line which outfits like Universal like, developed a brand and constructed a pseudo-documentary mill, which churns out four films a year on the backs of his subdirectors and interns which he then markets.
[2015-11-08 12:32:47] <Emmy B> sorry do you mean gibney directed porn?
[2015-11-08 12:35:39] <noll> re that Herzog interview: in “Into the Abyss” H does not lay out full case b/c subjects were up for appeal, instead H shows audience just enough to inform, but not enough to prejudice future proceeding. Gibney used prosecution’s case to try & convict Manning whilst proceedings (before conviction & sentencing hearings) were still underway. WSS release: July 12, 2013 Manning convicted: July 30, sentenced August 21
[2015-11-08 12:37:09] <WISE Up Action> Thanks for the background, WLs. Explains the state of play. imo dishonest = corrupt. And, yes, I remember that, H – it was outrageous.
[2015-11-08 12:42:25] <M> From that time, too https://twitter.com/carwinb/status/402956460729966592
[2015-11-08 12:44:03] <WISE Up Action> But you only had to know the TITLE of *that* film to know where it was coming from.
[2015-11-08 12:47:43] <M> It’s always fun to go back at watch Gibney at Frontline Club. He got massacred. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LENm73uNsVw
[2015-11-08 12:51:44] <WikiLeaks> Gibney produced a number of sexploitation films including The World of Sex.
[2015-11-08 12:53:43] <WikiLeaks> He’s worked hard to erase most traces.
[2015-11-08 12:54:03] <WISE Up Action> Title said it all before you’d even seen one frame (ha ha). Most ‘sympathetic’ people in it Lamo and Hayden. And Manning eviscerated and set up. Yes, indeed, M; poor old Gibney, eh? And he always talks about the flack he gets as though its persecution.
[2015-11-08 13:36:02] <Emmy B> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/logancij16/status/662020538831921153
[2015-11-08 14:19:12] <voidiss> The tricky thing of We Steal Secret is that when it starts, you may even get misled and think that it’s a rather good documentary. Not perfect, but rather good. Then, as it continues, it becomes more and more skewed, biased and full of falsities, and any person who is even a little bit genuinely informed understands where Gibney actually wants to go. He did manage to make Lamo look like a fucking tragic hero! Divided between his timeless, immense, superhuman sense of justice, duty to reveal a threat to mankind, and his pity and love for a friend who he wouldn’t have wanted to betray but had to. He cries while Gibney is filming, that’s the greatest propaganda effort, who couldn’t find Lamo a sympathetic figure after that?
[2015-11-08 14:22:38] <Emmy B> no one, his actions define him
[2015-11-08 17:56:09] <noll> the Gibney/ Lamo sequence is just about as sleazy/ dishonest as it gets. re inversion of Star Trek 2’s simple narrative concept – that there is no ‘no win scenario’ unless you believe, accept that there is one – is that just the level of cynicism, or are G/ L that stupid?

[2015-11-09 07:01:03] <Cabledrum> The judge was the same who has judged in favour of MGT in the case of PC vs. MGT.

[2015-11-09 07:07:04] <WISE Up Action> What a pain! What was the reasoning, Cable? Seems incomprehensible if they accepted it was in the public domain through him publishing it himself??
[2015-11-09 07:11:47] <noll> Action, it does now. Wls?
[2015-11-09 07:19:23] <Cabledrum> The court found that MGT is not a “person of public interest” and thus the publication of his photo violates his privacy rights
[2015-11-09 07:39:43] <M> Karin Rosander is questioning the UK FCO statistic of 44 people being questioned in UK while JA detained, still claiming it’s unusual for Swe to question people abroad. http://www.journalisten.se/nyheter/manga-misstankta-forhors-i-storbritannen#.VkC4TDUTTs8.twitter
[2015-11-09 07:44:28] <noll> we heard from Nesser August 14. he wrote “This is very interesting, but the prosecutor in Sweden claims that most of these are interviews with witnesses, not suspects. Do you have information about how many of these 44 that are actually suspects?”
[2015-11-09 07:45:27] <noll> Dear Johannes Nesser,
The FOI in question can be found here:
          (function() { var scribd = document.createElement("script"); scribd.type = "text/javascript"; scribd.async = true; scribd.src = "https://www.scribd.com/javascripts/embed_code/inject.js"; var s = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(scribd, s); })()        
[2015-11-09 07:45:42] <voidiss> Oh, fuck. I’m very sorry, Cabledrum. He’s the owner of the forum that has even openly given documents to Ball, and although this is a dumb thing, it’s also something that surely qualify him as person of public interest. A dumb person or public interest, but still a person of public interest.
[2015-11-09 07:47:38] <noll> & he didn’t completely ignore it. that’s new.. “But the documentation that the journalist has now gained access to show that it is not at all unusual that Swedish prosecutors conducting interviews with suspects in Britain.”
[2015-11-09 07:48:41] <WISE Up Action> What about random members of the public who have their photos taken and published by the press etc? I didn’t know there was any such thing as a law protecting people’s right not to have their photos in the public domain – except perhaps some guidelines re children.
[2015-11-09 07:49:01] <LibertarianLibrarian> Sorry to hear that Cable! This guy is so slippery. Hopefully, sooner or later, it will all catch up with him.
[2015-11-09 07:50:06] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, the ruling doesn’t make sense. Once it’s out on the internet, it’s out there. Unless it’s a copyright argument and I don’t hear that in this. In fact, that would be just as iffy.
[2015-11-09 07:51:09] <LibertarianLibrarian> Also, he’s tried very hard to make himself a person of public interest, yet now he’s arguing that he’s not… totally senseless.
[2015-11-09 07:56:04] <voidiss> “I wonder if the information in the article can possibly come from Britain. It sounds unlikely that which registers all requests for legal assistance relating to interrogation.” Wow, Rosander’s directly trying to question the authenticity of the FOIA request, not just of the number of interviews! Is she suggesting your have made it up? Because this could be a serious accusation against your reputation. False, obviously.
[2015-11-09 08:03:16] <noll> Nesser got HO to answer FOI breaking down the 44 MLA requests – but HO told us they wouldn’t do that.. will ask him for copy. https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickard_Berghorn
[2015-11-09 08:05:58] <noll> Greta, yes, does sound like that’s exactly what Rosander was suggesting.
[2015-11-09 08:07:13] <voidiss> HO conceded him a more detailed and specific answer than yours? This tells a lot about bias in answering to FOI requests. Nesser is a Swedish journalists (and everyone knows how Swedish journalists are, the ‘duckpond’ as Rix says), so they gave him a better response because they thought he wouldn’t have done anything ‘damaging’. Instead, they gave you a more superficial one because they knew you are WL supporters and more willing to do a strong and critical report about it.
[2015-11-09 08:08:03] <noll> haha my tweet has been disappeared!! https://twitter.com/hazelpress/status/663731667195023360

[2015-11-09 08:11:06] <noll> we’re wrong, our question to HO re witnesses or suspects wasn’t specific enough.
[2015-11-09 08:14:59] <noll> & neither was the follow up question (c), which lead us to believe wouldn’t be answered.

[2015-11-10 03:03:40] <voidiss> Oh god. Google has open-sourced its artificial intelligence engine: http://www.wired.com/2015/11/google-open-sources-its-artificial-intelligence-engine/
[2015-11-10 03:07:05] <noll> “This is really interesting,” says Chris Nicholson, who runs a deep learning startup called Sky[net]mind.
[2015-11-10 03:22:24] <voidiss> Imo. The early O’Reilly’s advice was practically to sell the AI technology, so that Google would have made money and other projects would
[2015-11-10 03:22:49] <voidiss> have had the improvements of Google’s advanced systems. Obviously this would have been scary because Google’s tech would have spread
[2015-11-10 03:23:08] <voidiss> all over the tech world, widening its control dragnet etc. Now they come out with this move, but they don’t open-source the program
[2015-11-10 03:23:23] <voidiss> as a whole, just a part of it, “algorithms that run atop the engine”, keeping the others to be sold with specific apps and partners etc.
[2015-11-10 03:23:50] <voidiss> So, in this way, they will have bits of its engine freely improved by tech experts all around the world
[2015-11-10 03:24:04] <voidiss> and used by many different projects, and the remaining secret bits diffused through sale.
[2015-11-10 03:24:07] <voidiss> So, the result would still be a global Google supremacy, but meanwhile they counter the accusations of opacity.
[2015-11-10 03:38:30] <noll> where to begin.. “Google Cardboard’s New York Times Experiment Just Hooked a Generation on VR” http://www.wired.com/2015/11/google-cardboards-new-york-times-experiment-just-hooked-a-generation-on-vr
[2015-11-10 03:51:19] <WikiLeaks> The purpose of google’s open source strategy is to have engineers gravitate towards its systems and standards. This constructs an ecosystem which displaces potential rivals (you can’t compete with free), companies that depend on google, and perhaps, most importantly, produces engineers familiar with Google’s systems which it can then hire with minimal retraining.
[2015-11-10 03:53:13] <WikiLeaks> It’s a form of intellectual property dumping, just like China dumping pig iron, or Saudi dumping oil to wipe out smaller scale producers.
[2015-11-10 03:54:59] <WikiLeaks> It is perhaps one of the realisations of the successes they had with destroying the phone OS market by open sourcing most of aAndroid.
[2015-11-10 03:56:33] <WikiLeaks> Far from allowing everyone to do it, it drives the price point down so much no one else can compete, so as long as they have a small comparitive advantage (they have the programmers who know the code best, withold some of the code, have the code by default integrate with their systems), they’re able to wipe out everyone else.
[2015-11-10 04:04:05] <voidiss> Thank you very much for the insight, WL.
[2015-11-10 04:04:18] <voidiss> What a tricky and silent way to gain more control and supremacy.
[2015-11-10 04:04:33] <voidiss> The move seems to be a willing step towards openness and sharing to improve global tech community,
[2015-11-10 04:04:45] <voidiss> while instead it’s just another way to destroy competition and become more and more a monopoly.
[2015-11-10 04:04:50] <voidiss> The ability to use part of Google’s code will bring to a world in which almost every app will be based on its systems!

[2015-11-11 05:21:26] <Emmy B> Cambridge Union security arrangements for tonight’s speech. What a lot of fuss over nothing. They really are turning this into something bizarre. Why? I think this is for self publicity and creating headlines. https://www.facebook.com/events/1680233765522218/1681444752067786/
[2015-11-11 05:22:21] <Emmy B> Very counter productive of free speech if people feel there will be security presence, it might put people off or certainly increase tensions for no reason.
[2015-11-11 05:45:57] <WISE Up Action> Ok, just putting this out there: I am a new postgrad student at UCL and am still finding my feet there. I live outside London and study PT so I feel a bit out of the loop in many ways. Last week I had my undergrad graduation ceremony at Birkbeck during which the president, Joan Bakewell, lambasted Cardiff’s attempts to stop Germaine Greer speaking – JBs view was that freedom of speech and the ability to debate should always prevail at an educational establishment – a view most would share? At the same time UCLU have got into a mess re Macer Gifford. It’s delicate because Gifford’s supporters are insinuating at some sort of ‘Islamist’ bias against them in the union and mentioning orgs like Cage negatively and Cage’s is a counter narrative that I have supported. The Cambridge thing is a total joke! But one thing I have noticed re UCL and which may apply elsewhere is simply that some of these individuals in the union have disproportionate influence and yet are quite naive / inexperienced / uninformed to say the least. It leads to problems like we are seeing.

[2015-11-13 00:16:41] <WISE Up Action> Ironic considering the title of the event….
[2015-11-13 01:13:25] <Emmy B> hahaha “B-but” is this an attempt at humour re my surname? hahaha I like it!
[2015-11-13 01:20:17] <Emmy B> Indeed, how ironic, *but*, isn’t it interesting that Varsity’s article angle is full of attempts at portraying JA cornered morally by the healthy, wealthy British establishment young things and did you notice where it says: “accusing the women who levelled the accusations of being “railroaded” into making “trump-up allegations” by Swedish authorities” I mean how can one characterise as an accusation by JA the fact that he mentioned that they were being railroaded, is beyond me and any sensible thinking person…
[2015-11-13 01:21:35] <Emmy B> It is this article the longest I have seen on the matter and the most ‘loaded’ with overt negativity towards what it is reporting.

[2015-11-13 02:16:56] <voidiss> Nice article, really nice. They needed a way to re-gain their bold pride.
[2015-11-13 02:17:34] <voidiss> After all the shame they got with the referendum issue, after appearing pathetic and ridiculously biased with the security measures
[2015-11-13 02:17:48] <voidiss> that resulted unuseful because no protest arose, they felt ‘humiliated’ and wanted to reaffirm their ‘supremacy’.
[2015-11-13 02:17:59] <voidiss> The lecture went well, JA brilliantly answered every question and even challenged them with the video thing.
[2015-11-13 02:18:25] <voidiss> They were annoyed by this, so they’re trying to depict him as he was in difficulty.
[2015-11-13 02:18:27] <voidiss> I hope the video of the event will be disclosed soon so everyone could see.
[2015-11-13 02:21:48] <Emmy B> 🙂 I am sure it was all good but let’s remember that when a simple event like a lecture with a Q&A by JA in one of seats of establishment sends such ripples it is telling that it challenges it profoundly 🙂
[2015-11-13 02:22:04] <Emmy B> <3
[2015-11-13 02:22:51] <Emmy B> like most things that challenge us are eventually for the best
[2015-11-13 02:32:45] <voidiss> Oh yes, absolutely agreed!
[2015-11-13 02:33:02] <voidiss> And, beyond all this, it’s great that the lecture went so well, so those Cambridge students who still have a critical mind
[2015-11-13 02:33:05] <voidiss> were able to listen to meaningful things.
[2015-11-13 05:34:14] <WISE Up Action> It’s a sneering. arrogant article with so many matters of fact placed in what are essentially scare quotes. What planet are these tools on? Looking forward to the vid.
[2015-11-13 08:34:37] <voidiss> Pathetic to say the least, yes.
[2015-11-13 08:34:57] <WISE Up Action> They’re on Planet Wealthy Connected Elite, D! Probably bristling at JAs accurate characterisation of their esteemed career trajectory. The void/vaccuity where critical thinking should be is an increasing problem, especially in Britain it seems to me – in fact, just call it thinking per se! Such clarity of mind from our ‘news correspondents’ here: “Choosing to ignore the sexual allegations during his opening remarks, Assange talked at length about the challenges to freedom of speech…” Well, now, that’s so bizarre (NOT!) given the bloody talk was entitled ‘The Challenges to Freedom of Speech in the West’ Doh!
[2015-11-13 08:41:35] <Emmy B> 🙂
[2015-11-13 08:52:28] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yeah “Doh!” sums that up pretty well. Though I’m really horrified by this “safe space” = censorship nonsense. It is absolutely ridiculous! And a serious danger to free speech if we make it “PC” to disallow anyone’s right to speak their mind. I’m all in favor of arguing back and ridiculing someone if they say stupid, ignorant or racist things but this walks us down the path of defining anything that upsets anyone even for the most ridiculous reasons as ‘hate speech’ or racist or sexist or whatever ‘ist’ you want to use. Scary stuff IMO.
[2015-11-13 08:53:23] <LibertarianLibrarian> So sad to see if growing in academia, which *should* be the truly ‘safe space’ for free speech and open discourse.
[2015-11-13 08:54:38] <voidiss> Yes. And in all this, while they’re complaining about JA’s heinous behaviour, thinking about how they could smear him in a good way and other crap of the like as a bunch of senselessly outraged bigots, it doesn’t even cross their minds that, no matter if they agree or disagree with him, he’s suffering and his human rights are being violated and therefore, if they really care about justice, equality, freedom etc, they should do something. They are really selfless, open and jointly liable people, oh yes.

[2015-11-13 16:03:02] <voidiss> Terrorist attacks and civil liberties are always closely linked, as we know. Destruction of civil liberties usually is both the cause and the effect of terrorist attacks.

[2015-11-13 16:21:32] <M> Swift on Security also tweeted “Shut the fuck up, Julian”, but decided to delete it, interestingly.
[2015-11-13 16:27:31] <voidiss> No, this time I’m really confused. Ok, the policy is “everything WL says can be turned against them and be used as a smearing tool”, I got it. But this time… this time really, what is there in that tweet that could cause this huge wave of resonating outrage? Did they say something disrespectful? No. They were reporting the fact and pointing at UK/US/France role in feeding ISIS. Where is the sickening bit? Swift on Security couldn’t say it better: all these people should “shut the fuck up”.
[2015-11-13 16:31:01] <M> Obviously people are more emotional during horrific events such as these. It seems the original “not so funny now” comment is what got to people (carried the implication that it was funny at one point), as the latter comments aren’t being received so negatively.

[2015-11-13 23:01:52] <Emmy B> ok did mass surveillance prevent the attack? Have the US/UK intercepted anything like they did with the Russian plane explosion in Egypt? If they did why haven’t they shared it with France? Where is the intelligence co-operation?
[2015-11-13 23:03:02] <Emmy B> Is it a matter of a ‘needle in the haystack’ failure?
[2015-11-13 23:47:00] <Emmy B> Extremely concerned about Matt dehart plea deal http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/extremely-rational-anonymous-hacktivist-matt-dehart-avoids-70-year-prison-term-with-child-porn-plea-deal
[2015-11-13 23:52:48] <Emmy B> Also concerned that after Paris attacks Muslim refugees will be stuck in Greece without EU absorbing some of them the humanitarian catastrophe will only intensify as the flow of migration continues but also destabilise Greece further, strengthening mindless racism and facsism.
[2015-11-13 23:54:22] <Emmy B> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/FoteiniMathiou/status/665435080073027585
[2015-11-14 00:01:38] <voidiss> Yes. This attacks will create a terrible situation for refugees in France; they won’t be allowed in anymore and those who’re already there
[2015-11-14 00:02:36] <voidiss> will have to endure a hell, even if they often run away precisely from ISIS. And obv there will be more strikes/military attacks feeding it.
[2015-11-14 00:02:46] <voidiss> Not to count more mass surveillance and crackdown on civil liberties, obviously.
[2015-11-14 00:06:07] <Emmy B> bizarre that terrorists kill the innocent in Paris but G20 meeting takes place in Turkey who covertly supports islamists and is an actor in Sunni extremism in ME. All eyes on Turkey next few days for statemen’s statements and anti-terror security announcements that will limit our freedoms further, Brigade 77 will be logging overtime and since Russia is another of its mandate, I wonder how the West will tie in Russia in all this mess…oh yes… I forgot Turkey has already complained about russian aircraft into its airspace… hmmm
[2015-11-14 00:07:28] <Emmy B> chaos chaos all around who benefits?
[2015-11-14 00:07:47] <Emmy B> yes Greta I agree!
[2015-11-14 00:24:06] <voidiss> Who benefits is always the same. It’s fucking sickening. Always the same false rhetoric when there are terrorist attacks.
[2015-11-14 00:24:33] <voidiss> Let’s remember that after 9/11 Bush said “through my tears I see an opportunity”. Of course it is an opportunity for those in power.
[2015-11-14 00:25:08] <voidiss> Now that there’s a tragedy happening and people are shocked and emotional, this emotion will be exploited as always and ANY measure
[2015-11-14 00:25:12] <voidiss> will be accepted and justified. But I don’t need to say it, it’s well-known.
[2015-11-14 00:28:59] <voidiss> In fact, as this article says https://newmatilda.com/2015/11/14/paris-attacks-highlight-western-vulnerability-and-our-selective-grief-and-outrage/
[2015-11-14 00:32:29] <Emmy B> Have you heard Obama’s statement mentioning equality brotherhood freedom in French? How bizarre that he forgets these values were established through, actually, a revolution fraught with violence in overthrowing the previous regime. How Holywoodian of the US President…. Let’s strip reality of the uncomfortable bits and pick the sanitised slogan re-package it and use it as a media tool in the destruction of the very ideals it stands for. Exceptionalism might work for a US audience will it work for a French?
[2015-11-14 00:39:19] <Emmy B> Interesting how Cameron’s final remarks resonate with me how he justifies UK’s collaboration with Saudi Arabia on the basis of intelligence and security information ‘that keeps us safe’. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMh7RG6_Tp4
[2015-11-14 00:55:22] <Emmy B> Is US/UK collaboration with SA to ‘keep us safe’ at the expense of its other allies? In the case of Greece US/UK always favoured Turkey in its aggression and was used to further UK/US interests. There is some mutual benefit there surpassing all common sense almost… why not same happens elsewhere.
[2015-11-14 00:58:16] <Emmy B> WL/Snowden revelations show Greece’s 2004 US surveillance scandal was not unique in fact it was (we now know) typical of the 5 eyes spying regime on all including Germany/France/Japan etc.
[2015-11-14 01:00:58] <Emmy B> US/UK over the years has shown 0 policy considerations for Greece/Cyprus on important matters of sovereignty and human rights, international law and favoured Turkish interests instead as it served their interests too.
[2015-11-14 01:03:59] <Emmy B> We could then perhaps say that Greece/Cyprus is not unique in this respect (although due to size maybe disproportionally exposed to external interference) and that US/UK will favour eg Saudi Arabia grand plans (has any academic written about why SA finances terrorists?, what is its ambitions?) at the expense of its other allies, eg France?
[2015-11-14 01:05:39] <Emmy B> It is curious to me that from my perspective ‘The West’ positions itself against theocratic regimes Iran/Saudi Arabia vilifying one and supporting another.
[2015-11-14 01:07:51] <Emmy B> a big parenthesis here (My mum says Shia Islam is actually ‘the protestants of Islam’ whilst Sunni ‘the Catholics’, how is it we align with the hard core party?)

We stand in solidarity with the people of France – as with all victims of terror and violence. I have cancelled my engagements today to hold discussions on events in France with shadow cabinet colleagues and be briefed by Downing Street security officials.
It’s vital at a time of such tragedy and outrage not to be drawn into responses which feed a cycle of violence and hatred.

[2015-11-15 14:12:51] <Emmy B> there are so many countries bombing Syria: US, Israel, UK(drones assist), Russia, Syrian Airforce, France, Turkey, did I miss someone?

[2015-11-15 14:15:19] <Emmy B> A good thing to check what he writes, thx
[2015-11-15 14:22:46] <voidiss> ‘A free for all’, yes. Maybe Syria won’t be invaded as Iraq was, but it will be burnt to the ground completely. And, apart from the obvious reasons why bombing should always be considered bad, it is also what ISIS wanted, everyone knows this, so it’s really a deep nonsense.
[2015-11-15 14:26:16] <WikiLeaks> We think it is likely that the Western calculous has now changed and they’ll do whatever it takes, including co-operating covertly with Assad to eliminate ISIS.
[2015-11-15 14:27:27] <WikiLeaks> There will be a significant slaughter in the months ahead as ISIS is intermingled with civilians. They will also draft all remaining men. Since both West+”east” will be on the same side, everyone will be careless in their rush to war.
[2015-11-15 14:28:40] <WikiLeaks> ISIS has an intelligence tactic of marrying into the elites to co-opt the civlian society.
[2015-11-15 14:29:00] <WikiLeaks> It’s not so easy for the population to go their own way now.
[2015-11-15 14:32:58] <Emmy B> Turkey will never abandon own agenda and it and Israel will remain active long after others gone, see Turkish raids on Northern Iraq still on going after all these years.
[2015-11-15 14:33:38] <voidiss> Obama’s line at the G20 may prove these points… he’s still very committed to refuse a ‘boots on the ground’ strategy in Syria and before changing his policy wants to think carefully about whether any action could worsen their diplomatic position with Assad, since they want to open a peace of process… So this may be because, as you said, they want to ally with him against ISIS.
[2015-11-15 14:33:42] <voidiss> Is this change of calculus is just ‘hysteria’ or they have new other aims?

[2015-11-15 15:32:03] <WISE Up Action> Yeh. *That account* sounding increasingly hysterical – ott – gives it a well false note. And it’s spinning wildly. As for anyone else complaining about the use of ‘funny’, they apparently have no nuanced understanding of the English language. It’s a pathetic thing to jump on. Seems like the hysteria of denunciation is the spirit of the age.
[2015-11-15 15:33:22] <WikiLeaks> They’re just trying to position themselves by biasing the context of “not funny” to make people, in an emotive moment, not set the “not”.

[2015-11-16 02:48:28] <Emmy B> Official Greek position regarding Paris aftermath: 1. Greece will not participate in any military operation in Syria as part of NATO, its role in the crisis is to remain a stable partner. 2. Solution for avoiding such terror attacks is the exchange of info among Nato countries intelligence services. With regards to backlash on Refugee crisis. 1. Greek army’s role is defensive, it will support refugee crisis but will not be managing it, i.e. Greece is treating the migration move as a humanitarian crisis not as a enemies that the army has to defend against. Coast Guard, Frontex and other civil institutions are managing the situation under civilian management. 2. There will be no joint Greek Turkish patrols in Greek territorial waters. (Reminding people there are no international waters between Greek and Turkish sea border, Turkey does not recognise Greek sovereignty in half the Aegean, basically does what it likes when it suits). Joint Greek/Turkish coast guard exists albeit Turkish coast guard is better equipped than Greek and since they let the dingies leave their coast without intercepting them anyway, I just can’t see how they can suddenly intercept them if they are to go into Greek waters. In Turkish waters are invisible and suddenly in Greek waters are visible?
[2015-11-16 02:56:57] <Emmy B> Greek Navy is not involved in the operations currently but Turks will bring them in (remember they do what they like their navy already trespasses frequently and forces the Greek navy and airforce to be shadowing them around). If Turkish navy get’s an in then Greek Navy is forced to participate, then the scene is set for skirmishes and red alert tensions on a daily bases btw Turkish/Greek vessels. If anyone thinks all this has anything to do with saving refugees they can think again, consider what we are dealing with: 1. desperate people 2. ruthless traffickers 3. flimsy dingies. Why, if military vessel as much as approach one of these dinghies the waves they makes might just topple the dingy, not to mention that Traffickers advise refugees that the moment they see the coast guard to sink the dingy so then coast guard is forced to launch a saving operation rather than toe them back to the sea border and co-ordinate with Turkish coast guard to pick them up (this used to happen a lot where some small vessels were forced to return to Turkey) With the weather deteriorating from week to week the death toll increases, the journey is even more perilous.

[2015-11-16 03:16:32] <Emmy B> (article has nice photo of Carl Bildt masterminder of disastrous EU policy of helping the rebels finances by getting rid of oil trading restrictions. Is any, any academic, any western journalist calling the particular EU politicians imbeciles?, is any politician saying ‘lesson learnt’ or resigning?)
[2015-11-16 04:33:45] <Emmy B> Extremely important article on Greek Satirical Magazine ‘To Pondiki’ issue published 12/11/2015 regarding National Security and Sovereignty implications of TiSA with regards to the Aegean. It refers heavily on earlier WikiLeaks release on TiSA via local Partner Kathimerini to highlight that current EU policy via Merkel and Junker (pressurising Greece to accept Turkish involvement in ‘guarding’ Greek sea borders regarding the influx of immigrants/refugees) reflects commitments that EU has already made to Turkey via TiSA reminding that Turkey was responsible for formulating the TiSA naval/sea chapter and as a result it formulated it in a manner to protect and enhance its own interests to the detriment of the Greek interests and sovereignty.
[2015-11-16 04:36:53] <Emmy B> Unless I am an expert in such matters, which I am not, I cannot really have my own opinion on the matter as I have not studied the TiSA chapter let alone understanding what it really means for Greece. Greek Academics might have approached the matter but nothing has come up that I have read on the matter (Kathimerini did not exactly make a fuss at the time of publication) and anyway the media is pre-occupied so much about the economic crisis and the refugee crisis little energy or attention is paid to other matters.
[2015-11-16 04:37:42] <Emmy B> Here is the article in Greek http://www.topontiki.gr/article/149263/i-toyrkia-sto-aigaio-meso-eyropis

[2015-11-16 11:41:54] <voidiss> Mr. Robots had many positive reviews… The only critical note is that it doesn’t talk about the political situation of hacktivists, i.e. the threats of years and years of prison etc etc. And also it may have the collateral effect of incrementing the “hacker scare” with the idea of a group of hacker being able to bring to its knees the global economy. Maybe those Slater doesn’t have bad intentions.

[2015-11-17 05:36:03] <Emmy B> In today’s Brussel’s EU meeting of Ministers of defence Greek position re France: EU and Nato need to co-operate through the exchange of information held by secret services. on question regarding Greek Army guarding the borders Greek Mod re-iterated previous position The border with Turkey is the Aegean sea. If Greek Army(Navy) is deployed this mean we will killing children and this is impossible. They are refugees.
[2015-11-17 05:39:30] <Emmy B> This reflects the general position in Greece that Army is for killing enemies when they invade rather than the current wave of expectation that Armies should be used in dealing with the refugee crisis. But of course the army does have civil duties in national emergencies, mainly the putting out of fires in the summer and I recall them doing rubbish collection in Athens when the public sector workers in that sector had gone on a long strike in the 80’s 🙂
[2015-11-17 05:40:12] <Emmy B> *hehehe*
[2015-11-17 05:43:39] <Emmy B> Let’s see what this european army is going to be about if it ever comes about and how interesting that the French should suggest it. Shouldn’t they first sort out the structural problems with the euro before they suggest such profound federalisation step? I don’t like this thing but what does this say about the role of Nato? is it finally de-functed ?
[2015-11-17 05:45:49] <Emmy B> good thinking! yes, there seems to be ‘meat’ in it. Good luck!
[2015-11-17 05:49:35] <Emmy B> Kerry is talking about political solution in Syria, stopping the war and calling on Saudi Arabia to round up the Syrian opposition for UN talks. Is this the democratic opposition of the FSA teams and affiliates, rounded up by their champion SAUDIA ARABIA? he lets the cat of the bag so overtly? is any politician/ journalist calling them out for it?

[2015-11-19 13:26:25] <Emmy B> Please allow me a little rant regarding the fear of terror and how governments are using this to limit freedoms. This is entirely avoidable and I bring once more the example of my little modest very insignificant country….
[2015-11-19 13:37:15] <Emmy B> Several times whilst I lived there I and the rest of society experienced intense fear about an imminent invasion (M/V Piri Reis “was sent in 1987 to Aegean Sea after Greece announced that it will start oil and gas exploration in the region. As Greece declared to intervene, Turkey responded that this would be cause of war. The tension calmed down later with mediation efforts of NATO and the USA.”), Imagine going down to the supermarket on an errant to find the shelves empty from panic buying… the threat was as is now real. At the same time I remember both the activities of the 17th of November dominating the headlines, the activities of Mossad against the Palestinians and the police brutality in marches etc still, all these threats never became a reason to hold societal progress in the 80’s and 90’s which was unstoppable.
[2015-11-19 13:40:31] <Emmy B> Such terror has little currency in Greece as a means of population control in a country with deep knowledge of conflict of war, real hardship and political persecution, concentration camps, juntas etc so recent in its history.
[2015-11-19 13:43:55] <Emmy B> I think this hysteria is very much driven by political powers for their own benefit, it is not society driven.
[2015-11-19 13:46:18] <Emmy B> Unfortunately Clinton has the power to fool, just like Obama, her sheep’s skin completely disguises her nature. And having an ex-president for a husband…well in name recognition alone is very much there.
[2015-11-19 13:46:39] <WikiLeaks> We believe it would be much better for GOP to win.
[2015-11-19 13:47:28] <WikiLeaks> Dems+Media+liberals woudl then form a block to reign in their worst qualities.
[2015-11-19 13:48:22] <WikiLeaks> With Hillary in charge, GOP will be pushing for her worst qualities., dems+media+neoliberals will be mute.
[2015-11-19 13:50:18] <WikiLeaks> She’s a bright, well connected, sadistic sociopath.
[2015-11-19 13:51:24] <Emmy B> But Labour did not by any means stop the Lib/Tory government curtail their programme.
[2015-11-19 13:52:35] <Emmy B> And the Republicans are very close to being fascists so *sigh* …
[2015-11-19 13:56:11] <Emmy B> It is very difficult to realistically believe in a political renaissance in the US.
[2015-11-19 13:57:55] <LibertarianLibrarian> No one will win with a large margin, unless people get angry enough to rally around a more outside candidate like Bernie S. But I doubt that. Personally, I’m more afraid of Hillary than anyone else. Some of the Rep candidates are repulsive but the system will keep them under its control. Hillary is too much in control of the controllers and, as WL said, she’s a sadistic sociopath. She’ll happily do what the PTB want. Some of the Republicans are nuts but that’ll get shut down. They’ll be a puppet like Obama. I am so scared of what’s happening to my beloved America. Just terrified.
[2015-11-19 14:01:31] <Emmy B> Jenny, it is a large country and there will be pockets of liberality or places where local politics define life to a greater extend rather than Federal politics?
[2015-11-19 14:03:51] <WikiLeaks> Exactly. Obama is just a centralizer. He’s bad because representionally he does not look or act like that which he represents. Hillary has similar representation confusion, but she will actively lead the machine to a dark place.
[2015-11-19 14:06:11] <Emmy B> @ h agree. From outside looking in US has done it all, after world war II it has done it all, the torture, the foreign dictators, the Vietnams, Iraqs, Afghanistans… @ WL yes, it like having Psaki with a string of pearls deliver gov answers and policy of the most ruthless kind, but smiling and being altogether sweet. Horribly deceptive.
[2015-11-19 14:06:36] <WikiLeaks> GOP will generate a lot oposition, including through dumb moves. Hillary will do the same thing, but co-opt the liberal opposition and the GOP opposition.
[2015-11-19 14:07:15] <WikiLeaks> Hence hillary has greater freedom to start wars than the GOP and has the will to do so.
[2015-11-19 14:12:04] <Emmy B> What would be the thing that will bring her down? (we know that for the US electorate foreign policy may not be as influential) From the internal political agenda, what policy would bring her down?
[2015-11-19 14:14:37] <Emmy B> What type of corruption would be the one that make her unelectable? financial fraud perhaps? or has she been involved in undermining the campaign of a fellow Democrat through dirty tricks?
[2015-11-19 14:18:49] <Emmy B> But if she has spent years developing clients within every fraction of her party it is unlikely that they will disown her now.
[2015-11-19 14:21:06] <WikiLeaks> He role in the war in Libya is what should bring her down, however, the GOP is too close to others who have benefited to exploit this, it seems. That Hillary helped to sew the foundation for ISIS against pentagon generals advice seems huge.
[2015-11-19 14:21:43] <WikiLeaks> But the GOP resolutely ignores it.
[2015-11-19 14:22:40] <WikiLeaks> Hillary has so muc hslime on her shirt it is now hard to make dirt stick.
[2015-11-19 14:28:54] <LibertarianLibrarian> I think far more Americans are against Hillary than anyone realizes because the mass media is in her pocket. She’s going to fail in most of the large geographical areas, but they’re less populated, so you get the east/west coast population centers behind her and the rest of the country not.
[2015-11-19 14:29:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> And Sanders could surprise her. He’s a dark horse in this election and could shock a lot of people.
[2015-11-19 14:31:10] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, Emmy, this country is larger than Europe and has distinct cultural regions. I’m already planning my retirement to New Hampshire or Vermont or somewhere like that where local freedoms are held more dearly.
[2015-11-19 14:32:53] <LibertarianLibrarian> I’m just afraid this country is cracking at the seams. It can’t maintain this sick, wicked policy of trying to control the entire world and still keep its own people from revolt. Ferguson was just a pre-shock, this isn’t going to get better.
[2015-11-19 14:36:30] <LibertarianLibrarian> Americans, regardless of media portrayals or politicians (that system is rigged now) have a wide, deep streak of individualism. It’s culturally-embedded. No matter how drugged they may think people are… there are limits. Which is why they’re using Muslims and ISIS as boogeymen. Without that fear, their power center won’t hold.

[2015-11-20 03:17:55] <voidiss> Completely agree with what you said, I’m really scared by Hillary too.
[2015-11-20 03:18:58] <voidiss> In comparison, Obama seems to be sort of ‘transition’, a one that won b/c ppl needed a ‘moderate’ person to counter aggressive Bush politics
[2015-11-20 03:19:20] <voidiss> It’s like he is a sort of president who isn’t willing/ready/able to use the full extent of the power he has at his disposals.
[2015-11-20 03:19:47] <voidiss> Instead, as you all said, Hillary would exploit it without limits.
[2015-11-20 03:20:01] <voidiss> She almost won the last time, but he lacked the ‘experience’, the contacts and the power to do so, now she has all this.
[2015-11-20 03:20:20] <voidiss> And apart from her being a bright sadistic sociopath, her strong hatred for WL/JA is also damn frightening.
[2015-11-20 03:20:26] <voidiss> She would intensify the witch hunt even more, and she would be even harsher.

[2015-11-21 07:11:46] <WISE Up Action> Fiscal irresponsibility/inefficiency &c. Mostly of interest to Ecu opposition – who’re presumably involved in promotion of the info? There’s obv ‘foreign intel’ involved in Ec opposition so, who knows? Any info re Assange/Ec useful confluence for US. And is there more to come? If not, it’s a bit piffling.
[2015-11-21 07:15:14] <Emmy B> Question for me is what to do, do I go around with my usual “fwlf is a factory of lies” naming [MGT] and linking to my blog posts?
[2015-11-21 07:15:31] <Emmy B> Or ignore?
[2015-11-21 07:18:02] <Emmy B> Cabledrummer’s posts are of course more concise and effective, maybe link up to his posts including the entrapment attempt using Shaf. I am very tempted and more than willing but I am wondering whether I am actually feeding MGT’s narrative.
[2015-11-21 07:20:25] <Emmy B> Maybe I just send Eva the links so at least she understands who these people are, then it is up to her to handle this as she wishes, I see she has already ben commenting on the matter.
[2015-11-21 07:24:48] <Emmy B> ok I will do and hope for the best, at least she is will not be fooled by the name and worry that these are genuine supporters, but she is more than capable in handling the matter…tough cookie methinks 🙂
[2015-11-21 07:29:31] <Emmy B> Agree
[2015-11-21 07:34:41] <WISE Up Action> Meanwhile. Anyone else watching this? – w yanis v, mcdonnell http://bambuser.com/v/5938778
[2015-11-21 07:45:15] <Emmy B> Not all Miami residents are extreme right.
[2015-11-21 07:56:02] <Emmy B> Yes, you find great disagreement when the difference is material interest and the very thing US has been extremely successful in is to build material alliances, with groups within a country at all possible levels so much so that to even dream to extricate oneself from them would be anathema. And I am talking not only about issues where interests have been hammered down through corruption.
[2015-11-21 07:57:15] <Emmy B> I see the same clientelism in Greece even now both towards the US/NATO as well as towards the EU. It is impossible to even dream an existence without these two poles of power.
[2015-11-21 07:59:05] <Emmy B> And without dreams sadly the fear of change always overwhelms people and particularly as we have seen as recent as this summer in Greece groups who seek or hold or are supposed to hold in their hands the fate of a country.
[2015-11-21 08:02:10] <Emmy B> e.g. when I saw Tsipras Brookings photo opportunity recently standing next to ex US Ambassador in Athens Speckhard, the man who upon resigning his post immediately joined the Board of Directors of Proton Bank (lavrendiadis scandal) and six months later when the scandal broke out, the bank collapsed and was semi-nationalised to save it, Spekhard did a quick exit and never answered to prosecutors like the rest of the directors had to… what does one think?
[2015-11-21 08:10:16] <Emmy B> UNFORTUNATELY, fwlf is been retweeted to thousands by Ecuadorians.

[2015-11-21 08:51:56] <Emmy B> I don’t know a lot about Venezuela other than I should know more.
[2015-11-21 08:53:33] <Emmy B> If I was not so obsessed with Greece maybe I would have travelled to Latin America by now and learn a thing or two 🙂
[2015-11-21 08:53:50] <Emmy B> All good references, thank you!
[2015-11-21 08:56:46] <Emmy B> But just to finish off the point I was making earlier about faking identities to do political assassinations as well as false flags or muddle the water, I tweeted last week regarding Biometrics database built by British Army and they very proudly put it into their PR Public Brochure they are world leaders in this field. Does anyone have any doubt that such information will also be used by the dark state worldwide?
[2015-11-21 12:00:56] <Emmy B> It is indeed disheartening that opposing such an opponent like the US CIA and destabilisation schemes harm the democracy they wish to protect. Problem though is what to do? counteract destabilisation schemes, bring about social change, push for stronger sovereignty at the same time as protecting the movement that brings about this social change. It seems US side has a double sided recipe to win. Whether US will claim Maduro is the new Assad or not the geopolitical game is without a mask by now. Syria says it all and we are all Syrians in the eyes of an absolute, unchallenged superpower. 11 million displaced not enough? Obviously not.
[2015-11-21 12:01:35] <Emmy B> 🙁
[2015-11-21 14:47:46] <Emmy B> very good article thank you 🙂

[2015-11-22 00:27:04] <Emmy B> Here it says that V’s state owned oil co has majority shareholding ventures with all major oil giants, so what’s the fuss? obviously they want the lot and increasing their owneship shareholding is bad news long term. http://uk.businessinsider.com/r-its-red-shirts-fading-venezuelas-oil-giant-embraces-pragmatism-2015-3

[2015-11-22 13:12:15] <Emmy B> Well Greta corruption and political expediency is not a privilege of the South, what a great equaliser corruption is then.
[2015-11-22 13:19:03] <voidiss> Yes, agree. But Iceland has proved to be ‘better’ than many other countries on some respects, look for example at the popularity of the Pirate Party or when they jailed the banckers responsible for the crisis so, even if I didn’t expected it to be ‘perfect’, it’s sad to know about that anyway.

[2015-11-24 01:22:24] <Emmy B> US UAV from sicily performs ’emergency landing’ in Suda Bay in Greece, Crete. Greek government has not authorised as far as I know the us of UAVs in any part of her territory. This landing is viewed as US trying to de facto sway the Greek government in the things to come, regarding Syria and the role they want her to play.
[2015-11-24 01:34:20] <Emmy B> They have been asking for UAV use in Crete and elsewhere for years. The reality is they will do what they want and Greece has little power of resistance. But the implications for the local population of the military activity in the area cannot be ignored.
[2015-11-24 01:36:31] <Emmy B> 1941 sinking of M/V York by the Italians just an example of what the use of the Bay may attract: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_on_Souda_Bay
[2015-11-24 01:39:25] <Emmy B> The 1979 M/V Panormitis explosion another example of the risk of devastation that the use of the Bay carries for the locals, not to mention the fact that no-one really knows what weapons are kept by the US/Nato there.

[2015-11-24 02:07:06] <Emmy B> Oh great! Turkey shot down Russian Plane in Syria, one of the pilots in the hands of Turkmen forces in Northern Syria? Who are these Turkmen? they are not turks, not kurds, are they local Syrian tribe or foreign unit from Turkmenistan in association with Turkey? very confusing… http://www.onalert.gr/stories/ston-syriako-enaerio-xwro-to-su24-lene-oi-rwsoi/46362
[2015-11-24 02:10:23] <Emmy B> honest to god, if Greece is asked to participate in a war against Russia due to Turkey’s actions, any GR government or Greek army general will have to permanently adorn a life jacket so as not to drown in the spit that will accompany them.

[2015-11-24 07:39:33] <Emmy B> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/iliassiak/status/669108073240334336
[2015-11-24 08:28:57] <Emmy B> An empire does not care who lives on a piece of land. Turkey occupies 37% of Cyprus. The Republic of Cyprus has not abandoned the Turkish Cypriots, they still have their passports intact and rights intact.
[2015-11-24 08:32:18] <Emmy B> Since Cyprus joined EU, they too are full EU citizens free to travel wherever they want and they do, they are entitled and get education vouchers from the Cypriot governments to educate their children privately, they receive their pensions from the work they did when island was united. In the meanwhile more than 116,000 settlers have been brought in, Turkish Cypriots did not want this immigration to happen and complained, no one listened. Turkey does not care for the people who live in their lands, see what they did/do to Kurds
[2015-11-24 08:32:32] <Emmy B> They are an empire.
[2015-11-24 08:32:46] <Emmy B> They do not care for people.
[2015-11-24 09:15:14] <WikiLeaks> How do you make that? The UN statement references to the total distance of violation being 1.15 miles in 17 seconds.
[2015-11-24 09:15:58] <WikiLeaks> Matching that to the claimed radar track, that’s the cut accross the Turkish “nose”.
[2015-11-24 09:41:30] <voidiss> Btw, the #WWWIII hashtag that was trending in the past hours is really that type of hysterical reaction we don’t need at all. It’s damaging, creates even more irrational and exploitable fear.
[2015-11-24 09:52:39] <WikiLeaks> “To the depth of” just means the max distance between the tip of the nose and the jet.
[2015-11-24 09:53:53] <WikiLeaks> It’s not relevant to the path of the jet or the distance flown. If the nose was 10kms long and 1kms wide and the jet crossed 80% in to the nose they would have said the depth of the violation was 8kms.
[2015-11-24 09:54:05] <WikiLeaks> Look at the radar map.
[2015-11-24 09:59:17] <Emmy B> The Daily violations of Greek Airspace by Turkish planes and the dogfights ensued create grey zones of sovereignty in the Turkish Book of deployment, they have the added bonus that a ‘hot incident’ pushes their claims one step further creating red lines for the negotiations and for the ‘give and take’ they wish to perform behind the scenes with strong partners they engage with.
[2015-11-24 10:02:14] <WikiLeaks> Greeks should fire a missile tomorrow.
[2015-11-24 10:16:20] <Emmy B> hahaha <3 nah! they won’t. 🙂
[2015-11-24 10:19:58] <Emmy B> Apparently here https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=el&u=http://www.capital.gr/story/3083168&prev=search
[2015-11-24 10:20:47] <Emmy B> Here is the Turkish Foreign ministry version of events http://www.mfa.gov.tr/qa_28_-20-november-2015_-statement-of-the-spokesperson-of-the-ministry-of-foreign-affairs-tanju-bilgiç-in-response-to-a-question-regarding-the-bombing-of-the-turkmen-villages-in-syria.en.mfa
[2015-11-24 10:22:34] <Emmy B> And this is the meeting that Lavrov has cancelled as per again Turkish Foreign Ministry http://www.mfa.gov.tr/no_-290_-19-november-2015_-press-release-regarding-the-fifth-meeting-of-turkish_russian-joint-strategic-planning-group-_jspg_.en.mfa
[2015-11-24 10:26:03] <Emmy B> In the Google translated article above is also claimed that Turkey will now make protestations to the UN regarding the Turkmen’s violation of Human Rights in Syria and try to tie this in with what they have wanted to establish straight from the beginning ‘a no fly zone’ 5 kilometres into Syrian Territory to consolidate their control of the border but on the pretext of well all kinds of things, first it was to protect against PKK/Kurdish attacks. then to was for Humanitarian reasons (for Refugees) now the Turkmen issue will get pushed forward.
[2015-11-24 10:33:26] <Emmy B> Of course the Cyprus template of HR been used to invade, massacre, occupy, ethnically cleanse and re-populate has worked well in the past with UK/US holding by the hand and materially assisting as well as legitimising it de facto, so here we go again it seems…
[2015-11-24 10:35:44] <WikiLeaks> It is clear now that Turkey acted in an exceptional manner (by its own standards) and that this is almost certainly due to the Russian attacks on Turkish backed Turkmen forces. Turkey is creating its on “no fly zone” in relation to these forces.
[2015-11-24 10:45:20] <Emmy B> Yes I see. A clear foothold onto ex Ottoman Lands. And of course once they do this, they will have free hand to use them to fight the Kurds. It reminds me of the early 20th century conflicts in the Ottoman Empire, one of the chapters was how Ataturk persuaded the Kurds autonomy in their lands if they helped his deal with the Armenian Problem (a bordering people with bordering land). Kurdish ‘irregular’ forces took part in the Armenian genocide and carried out the plan, keeping their side of the bargain. They were not rewarded though.
[2015-11-24 10:52:29] <Emmy B> Some more: http://www.aina.org/news/20150424144941.htm
[2015-11-24 13:17:11] <voidiss> Activists in Raqqa claim that white phosphorus was used in the airstrikes against the city on Sunday. If this is true, it shows a dangerous escalation. Just like Iraq. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/is-russia-or-france-deploying-chemical-weapons-against-isis-in-raqqa-a6745171.html
[2015-11-24 13:22:21] <WikiLeaks> There will be a genocide in Raqqa.
[2015-11-24 13:23:51] <voidiss> Yes… And people will do nothing, won’t react, will accept it without even questioning, because govts are good at exploiting fear.

[2015-11-24 18:35:01] <Emmy B> You see how MGT presents himself.

[2015-11-24 21:19:06] <WikiLeaks> Yes, but Starkey also comes out of that looking bad, and Red is younger and hotter.
[2015-11-24 21:20:06] <WikiLeaks> It reveals who she is, but for people who don’t already know, it doesn’t work.
[2015-11-24 21:23:10] <WikiLeaks> We just find it completely amazing that all the cliterati of London have entirely avoided what is the clearest, most grotesque, most significant and highly newsworthy violation of women in the UK in the last decade.
[2015-11-24 21:24:36] <WikiLeaks> All those fauximists who wrote about JA on very thin foundations haven’t managed a single article in three years!
[2015-11-24 21:25:32] <WikiLeaks> Just on newsvalue aone they should be writing about it.
[2015-11-24 21:26:55] <WikiLeaks> It is hard to imagine a greater violation of a person by the state short of murder.
[2015-11-24 21:29:51] <WikiLeaks> It has proven newsvalue as many real journalists have written about it.
[2015-11-24 21:30:16] <WikiLeaks> So it’s not a market issue. It’s a self-censorship issue.
[2015-11-24 21:33:42] <WikiLeaks> It’s clear proof that they’re fakes, even within their narrow declared idiology.
[2015-11-24 22:07:39] <WikiLeaks> LCD?
[2015-11-24 22:36:07] <M> Essay from “Studies in Intelligence” journal analyzing insider threats. Cites WL, Snowden alongside spies and murderers. https://cryptome.org/2015/11/cia-cpm-insider-risks.pdf
[2015-11-24 22:39:26] <M> Contains comparison chart of Benedict Arnold vs Chelsea Manning vs Aaron Alexis.
[2015-11-24 23:16:56] <voidiss> Agree, I think it’s self-censorship too. This kind of case doesn’t involve the typical target of the campaigns of those false ‘feminists’;
[2015-11-24 23:17:28] <voidiss> it’s the State who’s guilty in this case, not men who can be ostracized and used as scapegoats to highlight and glorify those ‘feminists’
[2015-11-24 23:18:20] <voidiss> as heroes who fight agst ‘rape culture’. The State’s guilty & so, since in average mentality of those ppl who, as WL said, come from Oxford,
[2015-11-24 23:19:11] <voidiss> State should be considered always inherently good, so they can’t write abt these cases. Moreover, I think there’s also another bigot aspect:
[2015-11-24 23:19:38] <voidiss> those women who were deceived by undercover cops were part of unconventional and ‘subversive’ groups like anarchy groups or ALF etc.
[2015-11-24 23:19:59] <voidiss> And this kind of activists are regarded as too ‘extremists’ by the moralists and not as cool as Occupy-like movements,
[2015-11-24 23:20:09] <voidiss> who are praised by ‘feminists’ instead.
[2015-11-24 23:30:57] <WikiLeaks> They’re perceived as lumpen proles.
[2015-11-24 23:47:30] <voidiss> Yes. ALF even ‘ecoterrorists’.
[2015-11-25 01:29:40] <voidiss> And think that today is even the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.
[2015-11-25 02:36:57] <voidiss> http://www.globalresearch.ca/russia-violated-turkish-airspace-because-turkey-moved-its-border/5480430#st_refDomain=t.co&st_refQuery=/ApXtLuGtiB
[2015-11-25 02:37:09] <voidiss> This article says that claims that Russia violated Turkish border may be due to a ‘buffer zone’ Turkey set into Syrian airspace.
[2015-11-25 02:37:19] <voidiss> Practically because Turkey ‘moved’ its border.
[2015-11-25 03:49:40] <Emmy B> Bless you Greta! amazing! Turkey ‘moved’ its border! hahaha All the tricks and stratagems employed here. I remember Craig Murray’s article on Westminster moving the English Scottish Marine border to influence the equation that produces what is due to Scotland for its oil reserves. Once again the old fox knows what to do ‘wink wink hush hush” (I shoudh maybe attempt at humour, in the Turkish case ‘hash hash’ more appropriate 🙂
[2015-11-25 03:56:53] <Emmy B> To turn the horrid story of police infiltrators to its head… from a different perspective the State prostitutes its employees (we know about the male ones but there will be female ones too) for info as it pays them to sleep with women. Is it that the proverbial Honey Pot has been institutionalised providing steady salary and pension?
[2015-11-25 04:09:47] <Emmy B> [Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/669488145835163651/669488145868726272/I3m7cU2N.png
[2015-11-25 04:10:40] <Emmy B> Erdogan: “resorting to the threat of the use of force should not be the rule of international relations” Hypocrisy much?
[2015-11-25 04:11:29] <voidiss> It’s amazing to discover bits after bits all the dirty strategies various countries are using. They work so well because in a confusing and confused situation such as the one in Syria, or when we’re talking about ‘weak’ countries like Greece, a secondary and silent move, such as a ‘buffer zone’ in the airspaces or ‘grey zones’ in the Aegean you mentioned, can pass unnoticed. Instead, if this happened to a more powerful country, the news would spread worldwide with global outrage. As always, it’s about how easily you can conceal your tactics.
[2015-11-25 04:12:01] <voidiss> Interesting perspective, the institutionalized prostitution! The problem is that the MET didn’t admit that the cops were allowed to sleep with the women, so before we need undeniable proofs that show what we already know.
[2015-11-25 07:38:32] <voidiss> Here we go. Man wrongfully convicted of rape has been exonerated after 16 years of prison. He was condamned relying only on the victims’ eyewitnesses. https://news.vice.com/article/man-exonerated-after-spending-16-years-in-prison-for-rape-he-didnt-commit?utm_source=vicenewstwitter
[2015-11-25 07:43:13] <WikiLeaks> Not a great case, in that he was previously convicted of another rape.
[2015-11-25 07:59:40] <voidiss> Yes, you’re right, not so emblematic. But still, it’s telling how they based the conviction only on the women’s testimony and performed the DNA tests only after lawyers’ request.
[2015-11-25 08:27:50] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/article19UN/status/669551593746997248
[2015-11-25 10:14:09] <M> Cryptome published “Ecuador Leaks” related to Ball’s Buzzfeed stories. Not sure if anything new: https://cryptome.org/2015/11/ecuador-leaks.htm
[2015-11-25 10:36:45] <voidiss> This is a full-blown violation of freedom of religion… https://www.rt.com/news/323448-burqa-nijab-ban-switzerland/
[2015-11-25 11:07:54] <voidiss> Do you think this is true? Usually, when there’s a ‘no’ as an answer to FOIs, does it mean it’s genuine or they’re trying to hide something?
[2015-11-25 11:28:59] <voidiss> Yes, agree, that’s what I was thinking too; I only wanted the confirmation that I’m not just being paranoid.
[2015-11-25 11:29:04] <voidiss> Actually, this policy of not revealing anything about those plans can be equated to psychological terrorism. They answer in that way even if they know we’re not going to believe them, but they still do this to create a ‘silent threat’ no one is able to confirm but neither dismiss that eventually generates the fear of ‘shit, what are they going to do to him if he gets out?’. It’s a form of terrorism, fuck off.
[2015-11-25 13:48:04] <Emmy B> Onalert.gr is a good source for national security maters in Greece and very to read. It has a section for NATO that hosts articles from a Nato perspective and receives sponsorship for it. In it, it clearly states “This website is sponsored by NATO’s Public Diplomacy Division.” so when ever I see an article that kind of sticks out like a sore thumb as “can’t possibly be written by a Greek” I check in case it belongs to that section. Hey ho it is good to know what the Nato Public Diplomacy division pushes out as talking points and here it is regarding Turkey downing Russian plane and the role of Nato.

[2015-11-26 11:11:53] <voidiss> Will spread it tonight! 🙂
[2015-11-26 11:49:00] <Emmy B> A different perspective: Just listening an interesting analysis of AKP’s surge in recent election results in Turkish West Coast (traditionally Republican) linked to Erdogan’s policy towards Syrian Refugees including giving People smugglers impunity to operate highly profitable operations. Just imagine how much these 550,000 people have paid the locals and the impact on local economy.
[2015-11-26 12:10:31] <WikiLeaks> Our pet conspiracy theory is that Erdogan took them in to train them up and use them as proxies and cannon fodder for his prospective invasion of Syria.
[2015-11-26 16:14:02] <Emmy B> Yes, bad news all for all around a worry to see Grey Wolves boots on the ground among the Turkmen. A clear intent to usurp any local Turkmen issue for this groups pan Turkic and racist agenda.
[2015-11-26 16:19:19] <WikiLeaks> We think it is inevitable. Syria is weak and depopulated. Turkey continues to grow and is the traditional regional hegemon.
[2015-11-26 16:20:18] <WikiLeaks> Only medium term question is whether it bites off half of Syria or just the Turkic areas.
[2015-11-26 16:22:57] <Emmy B> Omg
[2015-11-26 16:30:47] <Emmy B> Ok raya and giaur two lovely words every non Turk should learn because that’s how they called us for 400 years.

[2015-11-26 16:35:07] <Emmy B> Some still call us this way
[2015-11-26 16:39:07] <WikiLeaks> Rayah class system is interesting.
[2015-11-26 16:39:29] <Emmy B> I better check in The morning the list of MP’s in Westminste both houses on Friends of Turkey lobby
[2015-11-26 16:39:43] <WikiLeaks> It seems like the west is heading that way with the security/political/business class vs everyone else.
[2015-11-26 16:40:41] <WikiLeaks> In the short term its good for Greece that Turkey gets bogged down in Syria. In the medium-longer term bad, as you’ll have to deal with a more militarised society.
[2015-11-26 16:41:51] <Emmy B> It was a very effective islamisation or better put cultural assimilation tool via social climbing.
[2015-11-26 16:42:54] <WikiLeaks> Yes. Malaysia now has a similar problem.
[2015-11-26 16:51:16] <Emmy B> 1. Turkey currently seeks and will succeed the legalisation of their occupation of 37% of Cyprus. They are not ‘bogged down’ i think they multi co-ordinate across points negotiating all the time creating opportunities for themselves. Eg refugee flows used to get access to Aegean via common petrols, Merkel has already agreed. 2. They carry on the same known imperial tactics as they did in the Balkans after the collapse of the cold war.
[2015-11-26 16:59:25] <Emmy B> Goodnight everyone! Interesting stuff but its very late.
[2015-11-26 19:57:02] <WikiLeaks> That’s what they’re doing. Novoturkey.
[2015-11-26 19:57:33] <WikiLeaks> The problem for them is that the Kurds mingle the area.
[2015-11-26 19:58:52] <WikiLeaks> This is interesting, though needs better sourcing. It does confirm to Erdogan’s high degree of personalisation. http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-11-25/meet-man-who-funds-isis-bilal-erdogan-son-turkeys-president
[2015-11-26 20:45:24] <WikiLeaks> All the NATO powers are going to use ISIS as target practice. When that’s done, it’ll be hard to stop them moving onto the main game.
[2015-11-26 20:46:33] <WikiLeaks> If Russia deploys more S-400s that may change the equation.
[2015-11-26 20:47:13] <WikiLeaks> That’s very capable kit.
[2015-11-26 21:09:32] <WikiLeaks> Russia won’t hit US jets with those, but it can then sell/lease them to Assad.
[2015-11-26 21:41:57] <WikiLeaks> Wouldn’t fire due to the diplomatic cost.
[2015-11-26 21:42:25] <WikiLeaks> But it’s Syrian territory so it’s acceptable for Syria to shoot them.
[2015-11-27 01:53:33] <voidiss> Very interesting things, thank you!
[2015-11-27 01:53:48] <voidiss> Turkey’s not-so-well-hidden ‘alliance’ with ISIS could be itself a way to prepare an hypothetical invasion.
[2015-11-27 01:54:07] <voidiss> I mean, if they support ISIS, they have ISIS’s support, and therefore they’d have ‘local’ forces on their side in Syria
[2015-11-27 01:54:26] <voidiss> to fight against Kurds or other factions. By the way, maybe you’ve already seen it, but still, this article is really good about
[2015-11-27 01:54:58] <voidiss> Turkish/NATO role in helping ISIS: https://medium.com/insurge-intelligence/europe-is-harbouring-the-islamic-state-s-backers-d24db3a24a40#.lazbt4cj2
[2015-11-27 01:55:03] <voidiss> Turkish plans for invasion, since the Iran-Iraq-Syria pipeline would exclude Turkey.
[2015-11-27 02:04:39] <Emmy B> You can’t but knowledge Turkish imperial tactics extremely potent i.e.:
[2015-11-27 02:06:38] <Emmy B> Official Game: ‘We fight Isis, support Turkmen’s Human Rights, fight Assad the dictator (ex ‘Assad my brother’) give US everything, fight the terrorists PKK’
[2015-11-27 02:34:30] <Emmy B> Unofficial Game: Having deposed the Kemalist fraction from controlling the deep state including large part of the army/police/MIT via the ergenegon trials and arrests Erdogan now can control it. The new deep state reign retains all its business/legal and other societal channels and adding to that the part of society previously excluded or being kept under check the Islamist hopefuls. The presence of Grey Wolves in Syria’s Turkmen community (publicly giving interviews about the shooting down of the Russian pilot) reveals their role and even gives it a public role. In retrospect the Ankara bombings who targeted Kurdish democratic rallies with their high death toll, fits the profile of a Grey Wolves operation. It is alright for Erdogan to conveniently claim ‘it was ISIS’ and fit with West’s political hypocritical rhetoric about giving a damn for a problem they have created and sustain as a tool of furthering their influence and control in the region. The Ankara Bombing of Kurdish political wing by Turkey’s deep state (via Grey Wolves) is no different to them bombing the Kurds in Nothern Iraq overtly. Let’s not forget Grey Wolves attempted to kill Turgut Ozal Turkish Prime Minister in the 80’s so not only their ambitions, properly sheltered by the deep state, have no end, https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19880620&id=7TNAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=T1kMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5252,5375442&hl=en
[2015-11-27 02:35:04] <Emmy B> See here what kind of politician Ozal was: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turgut_Özal
[2015-11-27 02:49:18] <Emmy B> In January 1988 Papandreou and Ozal met in Davos and signed an agreement paving the way of de-escalating from the war path tensions prevalent at the time. Six months later an attempt was made in his life. Whilst Ozal was getting the bullet, Papandreou met severe criticism at home, a parliamentary challenge/censure to his government, leading to an eventual ‘Mea Culpa”.
[2015-11-27 03:03:45] <Emmy B> In an anti-Davos March and afterwards open sky discussion in Athens Peace Park that I attended at the time, in the panel was a representative of the Kostadinupolites exiled community. He above everyone else in the Panel, fluent in both Turkish and Greek, understood and explained the Turkish imperial policy over the centuries having been part of the last Hellenic community of Turkey, in Istanbul, uprooted violently during the 1955 Progrom against Greeks. He was now in a state of perpetual exile in Athens, how ironic that he would feel this way living in the capital of Greece… still… he was right that this is the only way one should look at Turkish foreign policy: 1. Imperial (which includes a brutal disrespect for HR squashing dissent at home) 2. Long Term Expansionism and looking at the Big Picture.
[2015-11-27 03:10:24] <Emmy B> sorry I am meandering in other matters but let’s say planned annexation of Turkmen Syrian lands came a bit of a surprise to me, Turkish state has been working on their annexation plans of Greek prefecture of Thraki more overtly, again the same template, “we shall have to intervene to protect HR etc”: see here: “The World’s largest enclave” http://www.mfa.gov.tr/and-the-world_s-largest-enclave.en.mfa

[2015-11-29 13:53:18] <voidiss> Yes, the same old misleading bits sneakily put into the article. At least El Pais has had the good conscience of hosting both Leigh’s article and JA’s interview re Cablegate anniversary.
[2015-11-29 13:58:05] <Emmy B> any of the other from the five wrote articles?

[2015-11-29 23:22:22] <Emmy B> the more I learn the darker the role of Turkey appears. What on Earth does the EU want flirting with Erdogan the Magnificent, war with China next? how much of the 3 billion that EU now gives to Turkey for the Syrian refugees will go to them is anyone’s guess.
[2015-11-29 23:44:34] <voidiss> Some more criminalization as terrorists of ‘anti-govt extremists’, defined vaguely as ‘ppl who don’t accept AU’s legal framework or govt’.

[2015-11-30 02:11:27] <WikiLeaks> UK, Turkey, Iran, US, France, Russia are used to being empires and still have the cultural genes for it, including extensive duplicity. They should never be trusted.
[2015-11-30 02:16:57] <WikiLeaks> Others, where there are still remnants of an older impirical culture, such as Spain, Sweden, Holland and 20th century expansionist societies such as Saudi and Indonesia should also be viewed with great skepticism.
[2015-11-30 02:50:58] <voidiss> And there’s Italy, which has always been victim of events apart from antiquity.
[2015-11-30 02:51:14] <voidiss> I use to define Italy as a lazy country with a lazy population and a lazy govt in any aspect.
[2015-11-30 02:51:35] <voidiss> It’s a country where bureaucracy is sovereign and where politicians look for mere money.
[2015-11-30 02:52:17] <voidiss> While in other countries like US/UK/Turkey and the others you mentioned powerful people look for power in the shape of control over citizens
[2015-11-30 02:52:27] <voidiss> and imperialism to improve the geopolitical position, Italian politicians are simply interested in gaining more wealth.
[2015-11-30 02:52:31] <voidiss> It’s a different kind of ambition, therefore a different kind of policy.

[2015-11-30 09:55:14] <WISE Up Action> Hazel – not downplaying how disgusting Leigh’s remarks are in that article – would be the first to agree – exactly why I used the word ‘cynical’ – not meant casually or colloquially, but meant in it’s fullest, darkest sense. But I was surprised that, despite the stuff about Cablegate changing nothing politically, he said this: “But Cablegate also set the dawn of a whole new journalism model, able to disclose unpublished information to millions of people around the world” and also that the article subheading (though granted, he probably didn’t set that himself) is: “Beyond the revelations, WikiLeaks association with five traditional media to disseminate 250,000 US diplomatic cables five years ago revolutionized our understanding of the actual foreign policy and inspired a new kind of ‘whistleblowers’…”
[2015-11-30 10:05:33] <WISE Up Action> My recollection (which may be wrong) is that he was loath to acknowledging that it was any kind of watershed a while back (a scoop, but not a watershed)? Hence, tho not at all surprised by the cynicism, I was actually surprised by what appeared to be the apparently more positive comments, and thought it interesting that he seemed to have been forced to a somewhat different view.

[2015-11-30 13:08:37] <M> Some background info from the judgement: “The Sheriff of Cook County, Tom Dart, has embarked on a campaign intended to crush Backpage’s adult section—crush Backpage, period, it seems—by demanding that firms such as Visa and MasterCard prohibit the use of their credit cards to purchase any ads on Backpage, since the ads might be for illegal sex-related products or services, such as prostitution. Visa and MasterCard bowed to pressure from Sheriff Dart and others by refusing to process transactions in which their credit cards are used to purchase any ads on Backpage, even those that advertise indisputably legal activities.”
[2015-11-30 13:09:34] <M> “The sheriff ripostes that he’s not using his office to organize a boycott of Backpage by threatening legal sanctions, but merely expressing his disgust with Backpage’s sex-related ads and the illegal activities that they facilitate. That’s not true, and while he has a First Amendment right to express his views about Backpage, a public official who tries to shut down an avenue of expression of ideas and opinions through “actual or threatened imposition of government power or sanction” is violating the First Amendment. “
[2015-11-30 13:12:59] <M> Great point here re financial blockades: “The analogy is to killing a person by cutting off his oxygen supply rather than by shooting him.”
[2015-11-30 13:26:30] <Emmy B> yes
[2015-11-30 13:54:24] <M> It’s quite interesting. In light of the banking blockade against WL, the whole decision is worth a read.

[2015-12-01 22:45:51] <Emmy B> M. Ignatiou reports that EU is building up pressure against Greece to let EU ‘help’ with border control under threat of expulsion from Schenken. Letting EU ‘help’ is seen with distrust in Greece as eg Merkel’s crazy plan of joint patrols in Greek borders with Turkey illustrates. The fact is FRONTEX is already fully intergrated with Greek border control but it is underfunded and in the same position as Greek border control. What EU wants is a more aggressive closure of the border. Remember the WL leaked release on the subject. EU pushes for a military approach.

He has no right to do so anyway. All Turkish Cypriots (not the settlers) hold Republic of Cyprus passports and therefore, already EU members. I suspect Turkey has obtained plenty of brownie points in its recent role in the Syrian conflict and therefore feels it can push for more in Cyprus. Both Lavrov and Hollande have visited Cyprus this week, Kerry Athens.

[2015-12-04 10:22:38] <Emmy B> If there is a scrap of truth that US planes conducted themselves in this manner from Greek territory that means US is determined to bring the war against Russia to Europe. Since Nato is in a hurry to bring Montenegro in the fold it is evident to me at least that the old Neo Ottoman crescent is to once again established as a barrier to Russia pretty much the situ with how things were pre-WWI
[2015-12-04 10:31:31] <Emmy B> Up till now there has been no ‘domino effect’ so much discussed when Arab Spring first was spreading in ME & North Africa, at the time the ‘Indignados’ movement in Southern Europe resembled externally what happened elsewhere but Podemos was formed and Syriza won, some of the movement found its political expression in the South, there was no revolution. In North Africa and ME Arab Spring was followed by brutal repression and civil war aided by external military assistance either directly intervening (Libya/Syria/Yemeni/Bahrain) or tacit intervention (Egypt) via support for coups. Tangling Cyprus and Greece, two European countries in this conflict militarily, Balkan countries with open national security issues, and surreptitiously strengthening the hand of local aggressor Turkey is very dangerous for Europe. It won’t end well for any parties involved.

[2015-12-05 15:26:51] <Emmy B> 😀 WikiLeaks Bolshevisks Leon Trotski & Julian Assange interesting parallels drawn by (Norwegian?) journalist discussing Turkey’s current geopolitical role https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=no&u=http://www.aftenposten.no/fakta/innsikt/Russlands-evige-drom-om-Tyrkia-8268979.html&prev=search
[2015-12-06 00:02:49] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/yeniakit/status/673410772643553280 Islamist Turkish paper published a “WL is controlled by Russia” article. It’s an absurd piece, but paper is known for hate-speech, pro-Al Qaeda etc, so not so surprising.
[2015-12-06 00:05:03] <M> Paper also has close ties with Erdoğan. Article likely in response to WL’s tweets re Turkish downing of Russian jet.
[2015-12-06 14:13:07] <M> Zeit published an attack piece by Jochen Bittner which is basically “WikiLeaks=bad, Anonymous=good”. It’s pretty vom-worthy. http://www.zeit.de/2015/47/wikileaks-anonymous-hacker-julian-assange-ideologie
[2015-12-06 22:26:45] <WikiLeaks> Bittner by name, bitter by nature.
[2015-12-06 22:31:18] <M> Hah.
[2015-12-07 00:24:33] <voidiss> The headline is amazing, just to keep pushing the idea that not complying with politicians’ orders and implementing encryption is a pro-ISIS thing: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/07/us/politics/hillary-clinton-islamic-state-saban-forum.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&smid=nytcore-iphone-share&_r=0

[2015-12-07 06:40:23] <Emmy B> Whoever is interested in the Syria conflict: 1. Russia is negotiating use of Cyprus airbase for striking ISIS in Syria http://cyprus-mail.com/2015/12/07/70492/http://www.seebrig.org/mpfsee/south-eastern-europe-brigade-seebrig-2.htmlhttp://www.seebrig.org/seebrig-commanders/item/593-brigadier-general-numan-yediyildiz-20-aug-2015-present.htmlhttp://www.onalert.gr/stories/etoimazoun-polyethniki-taxiarxia-poy-exei-edra-tin-ellada-gia-emploki-sti-syria/46670
[2015-12-07 06:44:50] <Emmy B> @ WL you see now why Greece will never strike down a Turkish plane intentionally as a means of deterring Turkey to respect sovereignty? On the two occasions Greek pilots did so, it was due to being forced to down them in the air as they were dog fighting (i.e. an incident gone too far between pilots and military commands) Political leadership in Greece will never start a fight or war as they know since 1974 the US (and NATO) is supporting Turkey 150% and working with them in everything.
[2015-12-07 06:49:42] <Emmy B> 99% of military structure personnel, training and equipment is NATO controlled and integrated. Pasok’s attempt to ‘buy German or French’ as a feeble effort to at least obtain some plurality in arm supplies has not in the least achieved any independence from US dominated control. It also backfired with a string of bribery scandals with German arms manufacturers e.g. Ferrostahl that eventually ended in the unprecedented for Greek political (non) standards for an ex Minister of Defence being in jail over Tax evasion and other fraud offences.

[2015-12-07 06:55:27] <Emmy B> Germany and France want more active role for FRONTEX in Greece (and we know Merkel favours Turkey’s role in patrolling the Aegean within Greek waters!!!) http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2015/12/07/germany-france-urge-for-more-frontex-powers-target-greeces-sovereignty/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+KeepTalkingGreece+%28Keep+Talking+Greece%29

[2015-12-07 09:48:50] <WikiLeaks> bean: for general images, please keep the swedish case to less than 1/5th
[2015-12-07 09:49:41] <WikiLeaks> btw, we have discovered records showing that ja was cleared of ALL accusations by Finne
[2015-12-07 09:50:00] <WikiLeaks> and that a case for false reporting was started by Finne
[2015-12-07 09:50:36] <WikiLeaks> three days later, Ny took over.
[2015-12-07 09:51:27] <WikiLeaks> it places this early history in a new context.
[2015-12-07 09:53:36] <Emmy B> <3
[2015-12-07 09:53:50] <Emmy B> this is wonderful news!
[2015-12-07 09:54:19] <Emmy B> the best of news, thanks for sharing! Good luck! x
[2015-12-07 09:54:40] <voidiss> Oh, wow, new bits come under the spotlight! And the case of false reporting? Did Ny stop it without saying anything?
[2015-12-07 09:58:16] <WikiLeaks> Never said anything to ‘ourside’ or the public, at least.
[2015-12-07 09:59:07] <WikiLeaks> Borgstrom’s role must be looked at in a new light.
[2015-12-07 10:00:39] <WikiLeaks> And also for why AA+SW have not denounced the investigation.
[2015-12-07 10:01:21] <Emmy B> Justice will be done! Just keep going <3
[2015-12-07 10:01:58] <voidiss> Probably he stepped in precisely to stop the case of false reporting, it would have exposed the whole set-up.
[2015-12-07 10:03:48] <Bean> wl re 1/5 – righto – understood
[2015-12-07 10:04:49] <WikiLeaks> bean your stuff is wonderful, but it’s important not to get bogged down in the enemies talking points
[2015-12-07 10:05:30] <Emmy B> It is the UK’s role in all this that has to also be looked at. Co-ordination btw Swe/UK would have been necessary to make the ‘charade’ work out successfully in UK courts. CPS Paul Close just the tips of the iceberg methinks.
[2015-12-07 10:05:48] <Emmy B> bean <3
[2015-12-07 10:08:16] <WikiLeaks> for swe, the situation has clarified: woman says police made it up, JA not charged and already cleared.
[2015-12-07 10:08:48] <WikiLeaks> we should never go beyond that, unless the topic is the swe case.
[2015-12-07 10:10:43] <Emmy B> ok
[2015-12-07 10:12:02] <Bean> thanks for that – helps me focus 🙂
[2015-12-07 10:12:59] <WikiLeaks> in discussions, the most effective technique for misinformed neutrals it to say they’re out of date.
[2015-12-07 10:13:07] <WikiLeaks> it=is
[2015-12-07 10:13:25] <WikiLeaks> It’s always possible and acceptable for a non-specialist to be out of date.
[2015-12-07 10:13:58] <WikiLeaks> This permits people to save face if they change position. Otherwise it is hard for them.
[2015-12-07 10:15:08] <Emmy B> yes, I have noticed this, once they have expressed an opinion publicly they are ashamed to re-tract so they stay entrenched.
[2015-12-07 10:15:35] <voidiss> Oh, thank you for this advice, I had never thought about ways to counter people’s ‘pride’ in discussions. Very helpful.
[2015-12-07 10:15:35] <Emmy B> good advise
[2015-12-07 10:16:06] <WikiLeaks> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/shushugah/status/673925871372263424 Can someone update this person?
[2015-12-07 10:16:27] <Emmy B> it allows people to cross over to a different point of view

[2015-12-08 00:53:01] <WISE Up Action> Trump needs to be stopped, quickly. Eckersley fails because she gets personal too quickly – exposes lack of argument.
[2015-12-08 04:32:02] <voidiss> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/trevortimm/status/674106837965398016 This tweet is gold.

[2015-12-08 22:37:04] <M> This “tall poppy syndrome” is interesting and bizarre. It reminds me of Harrison Bergeron.
[2015-12-09 09:09:48] <LibertarianLibrarian> That’s big news if Finne had started a case for false reporting and Nye stopped it. Shows a deep level of corruption. Wow. That’s even more insane.
[2015-12-09 09:12:06] <LibertarianLibrarian> I get back from California and big family thing and things have gone to hell in a handbasket. WTF re Trump? How is anyone listening to one word that megalomaniac said? Damn mass media is giving him all the air time. If they ignored him, he’d disappear into ignominy like he deserves.
[2015-12-09 09:12:44] <LibertarianLibrarian> What a psycho!
[2015-12-09 09:14:21] <LibertarianLibrarian> The sad thing is that he’s capitalizing on Americans’ utter frustration and disgust with out government. We want an ‘outsider’ so badly that people are falling for Trump’s bullshit.

[2015-12-10 07:09:57] <WikiLeaks> Today is human rights day.
[2015-12-10 07:11:29] <WikiLeaks> Might be a good time to push JA+CM at the more influential people using the hash tag.
[2015-12-10 07:37:19] <voidiss> I’ll do that when I come back home!
[2015-12-10 08:14:16] <Emmy B> Same here!
[2015-12-10 10:06:06] <WISE Up Action> Great pics, Em! D’you just go and take them? Yer a star xx
[2015-12-10 10:07:49] <Emmy B> with 2 others
[2015-12-10 10:08:10] <Emmy B> (usual suspects)
[2015-12-10 10:08:48] <Emmy B> we went a couple of weeks ago & took photos, been waiting for opportunity
[2015-12-10 10:09:06] <Emmy B> loved it! xxxxxxxx 🙂
[2015-12-10 10:12:52] <Emmy B> and of course we take ‘the bean’ with us and plaster his spot on posters *yeah*!
[2015-12-10 11:32:35] <WikiLeaks> Those pics are ace, em.
[2015-12-10 11:33:00] <WikiLeaks> If that was done three times a week at random times, it would drive them insane.
[2015-12-10 11:33:51] <WikiLeaks> Especially if its there during peak visiting hours.
[2015-12-10 11:35:14] <Emmy B> ok, we’ll see what we can do <3
[2015-12-10 12:14:29] <WISE Up Action> Ha. Mission! Think it’s pretty important to make sure it’s really random – no pattern. It’s an excellent campaign idea.
[2015-12-10 15:38:01] <voidiss> https://twitter.com/therealardin/status/675081741061758977
[2015-12-10 15:49:06] <WikiLeaks> Yes, it’s odd. We suspect the Swedish ruling class is moving to pre-empt bad WGAD/ECHR publicity by dropping the case.
[2015-12-10 15:50:25] <WikiLeaks> May be interesting to push her ‘I am have not been raped’ tweet at her, DW etc.
[2015-12-10 15:51:15] <WikiLeaks> It’s clearly a threat.
[2015-12-10 15:52:26] <WikiLeaks> You’ll note that her Icon is a photo of her dressed just like the Kill Bill assassin/mob-boss O-Ren Ishiis.
[2015-12-10 15:58:23] <voidiss> This would be great, even if they did simply to avoid criticism! Anyway, yes, it sounds just like that. Also… if the Swedish ruling class has this idea in mind, how could she know? It doesn’t seem any media is reporting this kind of thing, and no one seems even to mention JA case.
[2015-12-10 16:06:02] <voidiss> But isn’t there the risk that if we tweet to her like that someone could equate this to people like Sands and her ‘attacks’ against her and SW?
[2015-12-10 16:26:50] <voidiss> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/voidiss/status/675109087634456577 In the end I did, the tweet is gentle enough not to seem an attack, I think. Let’s see if she answers…
[2015-12-10 16:28:23] <WISE Up Action> She also looks disturbingly like Mensch in that photo. Sorry to be thick, but what’s DW?
[2015-12-10 16:31:55] <WISE Up Action> That looks good, Greta.
[2015-12-10 16:33:37] <voidiss> Thx. Anyway, I think DW is Deutsche Welle.
[2015-12-10 17:05:01] <WikiLeaks> She’s part of the Swedish ruling class.
[2015-12-10 17:05:31] <WikiLeaks> Greta, the tweet is good.

[2015-12-11 00:36:04] <WISE Up Action> It’s lovely, Greta! So passionate and animated. And you’ve brought out the backstory behind those emails beautifully. I even like it that in places the English isn’t quite right – it fits with the tone. And it manages to hold the interest admirably even though it’s long. It’s good that there’s a lot of ‘you’ in it – it makes it feel authentic
[2015-12-11 00:38:01] <WISE Up Action> And it’s about time someone got a bit het up about it! It’s appropriate coming from you. Bless you xx
[2015-12-11 01:16:57] <voidiss> Thank you so much for thw kind words, Action! I’m glad you like it, I tried to do my best.

[2015-12-11 06:36:45] <M> I’m pretty sure Ardin tends to block anyone who tweets at her re JA.
[2015-12-11 10:10:49] <M> Nice to see a smart feminist article in mainstream Brit press. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/12045740/Todays-feminists-are-so-out-of-touch-with-how-most-women-live-they-might-as-well-be-on-another-planet.html
[2015-12-11 10:11:14] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/JuliaHB1/status/631478400646049793 Author has cracked quite a few jokes at JA’s expense, but interestingly has also questioned the allegations.
[2015-12-11 11:02:33] <M> Wtf. “Nick Davies told in detail how Julian Assange passed him information about the US government and later betrayed him by leaking the information to other vehicles.” http://revistapiaui.estadao.com.br/festival-piaui/nick-davies-e-os-casos-wikileaks-e-murdoch/

[2015-12-11 11:59:02] <Emmy B> wow! fantastic! 🙂 that’s good news, very soon all of that trouble will be in the past :-)❤
[2015-12-11 12:02:10] <Emmy B> oh, and Nick Davies does not realise how he comes across to his audience, not very good for him I don’t think. The impression he gives is indeed mercurial manipulator and remorseless.
[2015-12-11 12:03:10] <Emmy B> not one word for the pain he is personally responsible for dishing out, no sense of responsibility and I am putting it very mildly
[2015-12-11 12:10:32] <Emmy B> quite sad to hear in part 4 how abusive his mother was and sent to boarding school at 8 were he was also beaten, maybe there lies his hardness and lack of compassion and a ‘let’s save our skin at all costs’ and bring a good man down in the process attitude ?
[2015-12-11 12:10:42] <WISE Up Action> That man has a chip on his shoulder like a bloody tree
[2015-12-11 12:11:17] <WISE Up Action> – oh is that what happened – OK
[2015-12-11 12:12:34] <Emmy B> note how he talks about his reputation and how much he values it, yet so ready to sally someone else’s…he admits everything practically he has been accused of over the years…
[2015-12-11 12:13:54] <Emmy B> how he hunted JA down to get the info, how he did not care as long as he/paper got their hands on info, how he retaliated
[2015-12-11 12:14:04] <Emmy B> a sad individual
[2015-12-11 12:43:12] <Emmy B> @ H has not tweeted or commented here since 30th Nov, all ok?
[2015-12-11 12:48:34] <WISE Up Action> omg – I don’t believe it! What is he like, the twat??! ‘in his initial statement’…shock, horror, probe…. ‘NEVER ONCE did Julian say to the Swedish Cops that he knew it was the US fitting him up’ Wow – you don’t say, Nicko! Cos, like, that would’ve been a really cool move, wouldn’t it? PART 3 from 14.20. I honestly never cease to be amazed by the total lack of nouse of the English chattering classes – they are soo narrow minded and thick it’s beyond belief – they’re like living in some artificial, pretentious fraction of human existence, and they’re so stuck up their own arses they can’t even conceive of the big wide world outside the rest of us live in.
[2015-12-11 12:56:37] <WISE Up Action> So his WHOLE premise for promoting the view that the suggestion the US were likely involved was entirely disingenuous, is that Julian didn’t *mention* this in his statement to Swedish Police. So, obv, not true, then! Wtf. How can you live so long and be that fucking stupid!!?
[2015-12-11 12:59:53] <Emmy B> it does not stuck up because he is trying to justify the unjustifiable. Whilst he was in a position of power he id the dirty now it seems he is not he has to find something to justify it… with every interview his story will change trying to find something that stands up.
[2015-12-11 13:00:22] <Emmy B> I agree with you Lindi <3
[2015-12-11 13:35:30] <WISE Up Action> But, you know, I actually think they’re so stupid they believe their own BS, at least in part. I’m not saying that’s any defence tho. Indeed, they have no business being so complacent as to, never, ever, peer out of the bunker….but it seems almost more depressing.
[2015-12-11 13:41:50] <Emmy B> What I find also remarkable is that he is very clear on what risks JA WL were facing to his life too, still, his perceived risk to the guardian weighted more heavily than throwing one man down the well
[2015-12-11 13:45:03] <WISE Up Action> Yeh – that self-interest is solid rock isn’t it? Never leaves them.
[2015-12-11 13:46:16] <Emmy B> Yes- Now he is trying to somewhat beautify the story of his actions nah nah – and the need to justify to themselves and his peers how reasonable his actions were.
[2015-12-11 13:47:47] <Emmy B> Thanks M for sharing the good news! With the agreement signed we can hope for quick resolution xx
[2015-12-11 15:04:31] <M> Ecuador’s official statement on the agreement with Sweden http://www.cancilleria.gob.ec/suecia-y-ecuador-firman-acuerdo-de-asistencia-legal-en-materia-penal/
[2015-12-11 15:22:49] <WISE Up Action> “We are close to the aim and we hope that the agreement will be ready…before Christmas and we do not exclude that it can be signed after the decision on the issue is made at the government meeting on December 17,” Riddselius told RIA Novosti.

[2015-12-11 15:24:31] <WISE Up Action> It seems as though it’s been agreed, but not yet ‘signed’? That was from 8th Dec, but the Ecuador statement seems to be saying there are a few formalities which will be completed ‘in the next few days’?
[2015-12-11 16:18:20] <M> English report says it’s been signed. http://www.plenglish.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4428741&Itemid=1
[2015-12-11 16:18:54] <M> The “in the next few days” refers to when it will take effect (i.e. it is not effective *immediately*). http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2015/12/11/ecuador-sweden-sign-deal-to-enable-questioning-assange/
[2015-12-11 18:55:29] <WikiLeaks> Hi guys n girls. Please test our web layout https://beta.wikileaks.org/https://piratenpad.de/p/wlbeta
[2015-12-11 18:56:05] <WikiLeaks> We’ve been going through a major development effort to make the site work well with mobile phones
[2015-12-11 18:56:57] <WikiLeaks> The style is a bit off still, but it is a big improvement for mobiles–about 50% of our users.
[2015-12-11 18:58:31] <WikiLeaks> Please look at every link/page and point out bugs/style probs/suggested improvemens in clarity
[2015-12-11 19:06:58] <WISE Up Action> Typo Helena Kennedy ‘adivsed’ https://beta.wikileaks.org/Enquiries-and-Contact.html
[2015-12-11 19:15:03] <WikiLeaks> About and Enquiries/Contacts pages will have text rewritten
[2015-12-11 19:36:04] <WISE Up Action> Should it be possible to get into other pages on ‘news’? Because can’t – tried p2 p3 – just reverts to top of p1. Can’t check anything on a mobile tho, only laptop. https://beta.wikileaks.org/-News-.html?debutpagination_racine_articles=50#paginationpagination_racine_articles
[2015-12-11 19:57:08] <WikiLeaks> Appears to be a bug.
[2015-12-11 19:59:34] <WISE Up Action> Very sorry, but totally incapable of using pad – ways outside my skills. Tried it w genny once and demented me (not to mention her) Just a brief response overall here: It looks lovely and clean. Can’t find TTP press release, tho I managed to find most of the others. Will complete chronological list of leaks be available still? Because I would miss that a lot.
[2015-12-11 20:02:18] <WISE Up Action> *TPP I mean
[2015-12-11 20:55:56] <M> New website is very sleek! Will play around on different browers/mobile and see if I notice anything.
[2015-12-11 23:35:29] <voidiss> I’m out at the moment, using the Pad by phone isn’t comfortable, I write here.
[2015-12-11 23:35:55] <voidiss> It’s very beautiful! I’ve tried by phone (Firefox on Android) and it works pretty well.
[2015-12-11 23:36:12] <voidiss> The News pages, About and Contacts/Enquiries now work without problem and are clear and easily readable by phone.
[2015-12-11 23:36:44] <voidiss> There’s a problem with the leaks pages though – they have still the old graphics so they get ‘warped’
[2015-12-11 23:36:57] <voidiss> when accessed by phone, the text and the images overlap.
[2015-12-11 23:37:21] <voidiss> This isn’t valid for older leaks (i.e. Baer) which have another different style.
[2015-12-11 23:37:34] <voidiss> The exception is the Spy Files, which have the new layout but the video is still not supported and is deforming the page.
[2015-12-11 23:37:37] <voidiss> Also the Advanced Search has the old layout.
[2015-12-12 01:48:07] <voidiss> Here Peter Sunde is saying very similar things to Julian’s “game for privacy is gone”: http://motherboard.vice.com/read/pirate-bay-founder-peter-sunde-i-have-given-up
[2015-12-12 04:00:08] <Emmy B> I just saw the Response from my FOI by Kensington and Chelsea Borough re JA: https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/301633/response/735846?post_redirect=1
[2015-12-12 04:12:41] <voidiss> I don’t know if this can work, but maybe you can split it in different parts. I mean, you start by asking only correspondence with government departments, then you will ask later for correspondence with police, then with traffic
wardens and businesses, and then with press and public. I know it will take a long time but each of them would be less broad and more likely to receive response.
[2015-12-12 04:20:15] <Emmy B> Thanks Greta all good stuff, I will re-submit before xmas, in the meanwhile I got one response from London Assembly, jenny Jones bless her

[2015-12-12 04:20:38] <Emmy B> I will update the blog
[2015-12-12 04:21:43] <voidiss> You’re welcome. Great, wonderful news!
[2015-12-12 04:31:55] <Emmy B> where is H?
[2015-12-12 04:39:48] <Emmy B> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/AngelaRichter_/status/675646270036426752
[2015-12-12 06:59:25] <Emmy B> Good to see you here again H 🙂 Thanks for sharing the tweet!
[2015-12-12 06:59:45] <Emmy B> (you had me worried there for a bit) xx
[2015-12-12 08:39:43] <M> Ah. Sweden hasn’t signed the agreement yet after all. “Anna-Carin Svensson, from the Justice Department, confirmed the reports.
“There is no signed agreement yet, but we are almost ready,” she says to TT.” https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&artikel=6324800
[2015-12-12 09:16:24] <Emmy B> Thanks for sharing M :-), it is only a matter of time I guess!
[2015-12-12 09:19:15] <Emmy B> Re Jenny Jones suggestion to write the Jon Cruddas (he is not my MP btw) he is described in US cable as a long time friend of the US embassy https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06LONDON7626_a.htmlhttps://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09LONDON1064_a.html
[2015-12-12 09:37:41] <WISE Up Action> Could I just again request that newlook site retains some link to old chronological order complete list of releases as-they-happened?
[2015-12-12 10:47:21] <Emmy B> “They burn Turkish flags and mark photos of Erdogan in Iraq!” http://www.onalert.gr/stories/kaine-tourkikes-simaies-kai-simadeyoun-photografies-erdogan-sto-irak/46778?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=onalert.gr
[2015-12-12 10:48:18] <Emmy B> Could Turkey become the external enemy to finally unite all Iraqi fractions into a common national effort were ISIS has no role?
[2015-12-12 11:09:40] <M> Wise Up – The releases are still in chronological order (left-to-right). Or is it the icon format that you are taking issue with?
[2015-12-12 11:15:31] <WISE Up Action> No, not really icon format. It’s just it’s not the list as each release (or part of a release) was published chronologically – they’re conflated/simplified in new format, and I can see why that makes sense, but I think the complete chronology is worth preserving somewhere.
[2015-12-12 11:20:56] <Emmy B> A chronological index page somewhere perhaps? – hyperlinked
[2015-12-12 11:23:52] <WISE Up Action> Yes – it doesn’t have to be surface display – just a link would be fine as long as it’s clear what it’s going to.
[2015-12-12 11:26:57] <WISE Up Action> It’s also a way of preserving (part of) the historical record of WikiLeaks/the times itself.
[2015-12-12 11:29:20] <Emmy B> 🙂 WL as a story 🙂
[2015-12-12 11:30:26] <Emmy B> Once upon a time…and then they released….and the world became a better place x
[2015-12-12 11:32:19] <WISE Up Action> Yes. The life & times of WL. Jolly good job there’s some positives because imo the world is an ever worsening place
[2015-12-12 11:43:24] <voidiss> Ohh, I’d love WL as a story! Something like–in a perfect world in which we have ‘won’–a wonderful tale to tell children, or a powerful piece of history to study at school! Sadly I agree with Action, but WL is so great because without it the world would be even more ever-worsening.
[2015-12-12 11:47:49] <Emmy B> 🙂 talking about history, all this Syria/ Iraq Russia Turkey and the West all competing for a place in a new status quo, brings to mind the battle of Navarino: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Navarino
[2015-12-12 11:50:59] <Emmy B> “A few weeks after the battle, in a symbolic gesture, he proclaimed jihad (holy war) against the European powers in his claimed role as khalifa (caliph, or spiritual leader) of all Muslims. More concretely, he closed the Bosporus to international shipping, a move certain to provoke Russia, whose entire Black Sea trade had to pass through the Straits. He also revoked the Convention of Akkerman, signed with Russia the previous year.”
[2015-12-12 11:53:10] <WISE Up Action> eee, blooody ell, Em – yer a walkin istry boook!
[2015-12-12 11:53:46] <WISE Up Action> (crap northern accent)
[2015-12-12 11:54:22] <Emmy B> A very different world then, a better world now, @ Lindi of ‘my neck of the woods’ only 🙂 xxxx (did I spell that correctly?)
[2015-12-12 11:58:12] <Emmy B> very interestingly I was just reading that a cannon of that battle has been found in archaeological excavations in Greece, and guess what the locals have immediately contacted Sevastopol in Russia to let them know of the find. If this had happened when I lived in Greece 25 years ago they would have contacted the British, how things change.
[2015-12-14 06:13:27] <LibertarianLibrarian> Hope Sweden doesn’t keep stalling on signing the agreement. They’ve got a bad history of that, but maybe the embarrassment will make them finally concede to interviewing JA at the Embassy. Then, hopefully, they’ll use it as an excuse to drop the entire ridiculous thing & leave us with the real reason for the entire mess – the USG’s ‘case’.
[2015-12-14 06:13:59] <LibertarianLibrarian> I’m lurking more lately but still here.
[2015-12-14 06:39:21] <Emmy B> <3
[2015-12-14 06:40:01] <Emmy B> BBC includes UK Foreign Office comment on the upcoming JA questioning http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-35089041
[2015-12-14 07:47:26] <Emmy B> Can’t believe it, the photo journalist we chatted to this morning at the vigil outside the embassy asked for a picture as we were taking our banner down, got his photo on Sputnik http://sputniknews.com/europe/20151214/1031733887/lawyer-embassy-questioning-scedule.html
[2015-12-14 07:49:00] <Emmy B> Article includes comment by JA’s Swedish attorney Olsen.
[2015-12-14 08:04:54] <Emmy B> Also Juan Carlos from NTN24 was outside the embassy and he asked me to say a few words to the camera which I did.
[2015-12-14 08:06:07] <Emmy B> It seems we’ll be able to hold vigils Mondays 11:30-13:00 from now on.
[2015-12-14 10:57:04] <Emmy B> And here is the video of Juan Carlos in NTN24 http://www.ntn24.com/video/paso-a-loondres-81890
[2015-12-14 10:58:24] <Emmy B> I said I am hoping that the political asylum granted by Ecuador is recognised by Sweden and UK and that JA would be free as a result. Praised Ecuador for consistently protecting JA’s Human Rights.
[2015-12-14 12:35:20] <Emmy B> Not a good article (in Wired): http://www.wired.com/2015/12/julian-assange-will-finally-get-his-day-in-court-in-the-ecuadorean-embassy/

[2015-12-14 13:17:06] <voidiss> Anyway, her Wired article with the “he pinned her to the bed” bit is the perfect example of what Hearne’s “Julian in a Nutshell” represents.
[2015-12-14 13:17:24] <M> The “Ecuador is finally allowing questioning” line is pissing me off.
[2015-12-14 13:18:38] <voidiss> Yes, just like Guardian’s “Ny was unable to question him”.

[2015-12-17 06:42:07] <WikiLeaks> There is a month missing from Cablegate. Peerhaps you hit it.
[2015-12-17 07:04:43] <Emmy B> Perhaps perhaps perhaps 🙂
[2015-12-17 07:11:48] <Emmy B> A bomb went off in provincial town of Larisa 29/05/2004 the first of terrorist organisation Laiki Thelisi (popular will) I was looking for reports. The organisation went on to at least two more actions, on one occasion killing a guard. I read an article in greek yesterday that D Foukas of Parliamentary Committee on “Pythia” the assassination plans against greek PM Karamanlis by a foreign intelligence agency- the article reports all three terrorist incidents were likely organised by foreign intelligence agencies.
[2015-12-17 07:13:29] <Emmy B> This case links to the wiretapping scandal the intercept published about recently.
[2015-12-17 07:14:07] <Emmy B> I’ll keep looking for any references.
[2015-12-17 07:26:02] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/m_cetera/status/677507368427499524 FYI
[2015-12-17 09:45:51] <voidiss> Sweden signed the agreement and will soon submit a request to interview JA: http://www.aklagare.se/In-English/Media/News-in-English1/Request-to-interview-Assange-in-London/
[2015-12-17 09:45:57] <voidiss> Uhm, deja-vù. Let’s hope they’re serious about it this time…
[2015-12-17 12:05:29] <voidiss> I’m doing a thing I’d like to share with you all… This year my school offered the partecipation in a project called NHSMUN (National High School Model United Nation), that is a big project initially created by IMUNA and organized by different associated orgs in each country (like Italian Diplomatic Academy in Italy). And this project practically gives students the possibility to take part in a course of geopolitics, international relations, diplomacy etc and at the end of it, they can to go to NYC, at the UN palace, to do a ‘simulation’ of work as delegates of various countries different from their own. In practice, students are assigned to a country, choose a Committee with two topics, follow the course and do research on the country and the topics, write a position paper and then go to NYC and debate with other students and do negotiations and in the end they prepare a ‘resolution’. This aims to help young people who want to become diplomats or something. Obviously I don’t want to be a diplomat AT ALL, but I decided to participate anyway because I think it would be interesting to directly experience ‘how things work’ in UN etc. A bit like ‘know the enemy’, lol. (joking!) The course started about a month ago and we already did various lessons on UN system and contemporary history (Cold War mostly). The history teacher was quite good, the other was strongly pro-USG instead (he supports TPP/TISA, loves Hillary and tried to deny the existence of WL docs on Saudi and UK plotting to be elected to UNHRC). But anyway, the course can still be interesting if you follow it with some critical mind. Anyway… today I was assigned to the country I have to represent, that is Ivory Coast. The Committee in which I’ll work is the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, and the two topics I will have to analyze as Ivory Coast ‘delegate’ are: 1) Palestinian Refugees in the Middle East, 2) Occupied Territories in Azerbaijan. So, that is, I just wanted to let you all know about this thing because I think it’s going to be interesting. I will share more about it! 🙂
[2015-12-17 12:14:20] <WikiLeaks> Neat. Not sure about the course, but model UN is mostly for hookups though.
[2015-12-17 12:56:11] <Emmy B> Well done Greta, a great achievement to get on the course in the first place x you will learn a ton of things and good debates coming up! keep us up with whats up and see if there is a Cable or two that you may be able to quote in your analysis 😉
[2015-12-17 13:08:22] <voidiss> Yes, they presented it as a good opportunity for hookups too, a way to bring young people closer to the diplomatic environment: in New York there will even be some orientation lectures about this specific post-high school path. But well, I can simply ignore this part and take the good parts of the project.
[2015-12-17 13:09:02] <voidiss> Thanks, Emmy! And yes, WL search engine is the first thing I thought about when they told me about doing research on those topics! 😀
[2015-12-18 00:16:13] <voidiss> Need an advice… If one has to buy a new phone, what’s better between Android and iOS?
[2015-12-18 00:17:03] <voidiss> B/c Android has more privacy-related apps but Google has its well-known spying policy; Apple has fewer apps but perhaps it is less NSA-like.
[2015-12-18 02:00:18] <Emmy B> Not a tech person, I consider everything compromised, and even after all the crypto parties I’ve gone to there is a certain resignation on my part regarding the matter, Still, if you have the money a Black phone seems to be a good starting point, they use https://www.silentcircle.com/products-and-solutions/devices/
[2015-12-18 02:01:06] <Emmy B> “Only Blackphone runs on Silent OS, an enhanced Android operating system that delivers privacy without compromise.”
[2015-12-18 02:03:16] <Emmy B> But you will have to be quite determined to improve the safety of your communications. The Blackphone is extremely expensive and you would have to expend time learning it.
[2015-12-18 02:04:25] <Emmy B> At least you have a whole life time to learn about such matters Greta dear, so keep at it <3 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackphone
[2015-12-18 03:25:02] <voidiss> Eh. I already knew about Blackphones but they’re very expensive & since that soon I’ll have to change my pc too, I’d prefer to spend less :/
[2015-12-18 03:26:06] <Emmy B> Absolutely!
[2015-12-18 03:26:10] <voidiss> One day I will surely buy a Blackphone, but I want to wait until I really need it.
[2015-12-18 03:26:16] <voidiss> Thank you anyway, Emmy. 🙂

[2015-12-19 12:24:10] <Emmy B> I am curious as to why 10ATHENS141-a cable dated 25th of Feb would be followed by 10ATHENS142_a dated 1st of Feb, I thought the serial number denoted the order upon which the Cables would be dispatched, Maybe then US Embassy staff opened a Cable reference and started typing, being allocated a serial number at that point rather at the point of sending it? It is the only explanation I can think of.
[2015-12-19 12:36:15] <Emmy B> There is also something very curious about cable 10ATHENS141-a it describes the content of a 45 minute visit 8th of Feb with Director General of Greek Intelligence services Bikas, in Jan 22 US Ambassador had met with Bikas boss Minister of Public Protection Chrysochoidis. These meetings two out of four extensive meetings in 4 months had as content terrorism as well as co-operation btw US/Greek SS. The curious thing is, if Cable is dated 25th of Feb how is it that it does not mention the terrorist activity against Minister Chrysochoidis on the 17th of Feb (a bomb exploded in his electoral centre by terrorist organisation Laiki Thelisi). Heh the Cable does mention though that on the 9th of Feb Bikas was appearing at a parliament to answer questions about the 2004/5 wiretapping scandal. (In retrospect, knowing from the Snowden revelations it was the NSA/CIA with the direct involvement of the US Embassy behind this scandal, I wonder how Spekhard felt been told by Bikas this titbit, maybe he thought it bad manners?)
[2015-12-19 12:37:00] <Emmy B> I really have to find a place to put such stuff rather than spam our chat…
[2015-12-19 12:42:09] <WikiLeaks> Possibly sent through CIA channels or TS channels. Note that TS cables also increase the cable count.
[2015-12-19 12:43:56] <Emmy B> Thank you, sorry what is TS?
[2015-12-19 12:49:00] <Emmy B> ah, TS = Top Secret, ok

[2015-12-20 10:34:52] <voidiss> Yes. It seems to be the logo of @Justice4Assange, another group (I suppose) supporting JA. The Twitter account hasn’t been active since 2012, though.
[2015-12-20 10:35:15] <Emmy B> it is associated with a previous endeavour I believe

[2015-12-28 13:33:32] <voidiss> Oh yes, a lot of fun! CCC is always great, a wonderful opportunity to meet many people, and plus this year there are many interesting lectures. This morning I followed one about the philosophical concept of privacy based on Hannah Arendt thoughts, and it was great. Also the one about the terrible line adopted by France in terms of surveillance was good, even if very depressing. Yesterday I followed one in which the speaker showed some photos from the Stasi archives which were hilarious (spies taking photos of enemy spies that was taking photos of them, or spies taking photos of themselves in mirrors). And the speaker also noted that while Stasi archives are more or less public and accessible, when he asked to the BND they gave him meaningless photos, so everyone can see how bad Stasi was but no one can see the crimes that surely also BND committed in that period.

[2016-01-06 12:51:14] <Emmy B> he published all correspondence he had with hazelpress in the past twisting everything if I remember correctly, plus he stalk you after as he did with Bella
[2016-01-06 12:53:51] <Emmy B> also we know all we need to know about him, unlikely any correspondance you have be insightful.
[2016-01-06 12:57:58] <Emmy B> if you want to communicate with him I would advise do it in public, give him nothing he can twist or use, any private correspondance he can use by referring to it without others knowing what it is and present it as he likes.
[2016-01-06 12:59:48] <WISE Up Action> Ignore him. No obligation to respond in any way.
[2016-01-06 18:36:06] <WikiLeaks> He’s a troll. Ignore/ban.

[2016-01-07 14:33:19] <WISE Up Action> Am I being thick, Em, or is your IBTimes link the wrong one?
[2016-01-07 15:06:50] <voidiss> Ha. Interesting post by Craig Murray about false ‘feminism’ and odd differencies on how JA’s, Danczuk’s and other cases were treated by ‘feminists’: https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/01/feminism-a-neo-con-tool/
[2016-01-07 15:20:48] <Emmy B> @ Wise up haha you are right! it should be the review of a novel

[2016-01-07 23:54:45] <Emmy B> Before we dismiss Luise Mensch as a loony and her ‘collaboration’ with MGT in publishing stuff on JA as irrelevant, let’s re-visit her Telegraph article from 2012: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9490212/George-Galloway-Todd-Akin-and-other-male-politicians-still-getting-it-wrong-on-rape.html

Actually a lawyer (now unemployable ofc) Never come across him before. Doesn’t have a good word to say about journos! I found him interesting, pretty well researched,sounds like he has integrity & is doggedly going on despite all the usual problems incurred through whistleblowing. Think he probably deserves support.
[2016-01-09 00:13:20] <M> Dug up some cables referenced in this article: http://www.thenews.com.pk/print/89034-US-UK-rubbished-Indias-evidence-against-Pakistan-in-Mumbai-attacks-says-Wikileakshttps://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09NEWDELHI1778_a.htmlhttps://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06NEWDELHI7360_a.htmlhttps://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08NEWDELHI3044_a.html

[2016-01-09 03:18:24] <Emmy B> Let’s hope he has/gets docs out.

[2016-01-09 04:46:24] <M> There was another Hillary email release on Jan 6 — less than 10 WL related emails.

[2016-01-09 07:04:57] <Emmy B> @ WL just a little info, the article in French you re-tweeted http://info.yamar.org/2016/01/09/exclusif-wikileaks-le-gouvernement-britannique-exhorte-a-reveler-son-role-dans-laccession-de-larabie-saoudite-au-conseil-des-droits-de-lhomme-des-nations-unies/https://wikileaksactu.wordpress.com/2016/01/08/exclusif-le-gouvernement-britannique-exhorte-a-reveler-son-role-dans-laccession-de-larabie-saoudite-au-conseil-des-droits-de-lhomme-des-nations-unies/
[2016-01-09 07:11:54] <WISE Up Action> What’s the SP on Rob Evans (Guardian)? He just retweeted our tweet abt Jenny Jones.
[2016-01-09 07:23:14] <Emmy B> His work is very relevant to the WL themes http://www.theguardian.com/profile/robevans
[2016-01-09 07:33:02] <WISE Up Action> Yer – I get that but does he have any negatives fr a WL perspective – ie has he been hostile in the past? Sorry – I shld just research myself I know! I just thought that I’d ask…
[2016-01-09 07:33:38] <Emmy B> Will research now
[2016-01-09 07:53:35] <Emmy B> Worked very closely with David Leigh on BAE corruption scandal and they both received in 2007 Paul Foot award from Private Eye and the Guardian for those stories.
[2016-01-09 07:54:38] <Emmy B> He has written about WL in the past. With a previous twitter account, he retweeted David Leigh’s spiteful tweets about JA
[2016-01-09 08:04:29] <Emmy B> “Rob Evans, Guardian journalist and co-author with Paul Lewis of Undercover: the True Story of Britain’s Secret Police;”
[2016-01-09 08:06:10] <Emmy B> You will find a podcast by him about this book here http://backdoorbroadcasting.net/2013/12/state-surveillance-counter-terror-powers-and-global-securitisation-strategies/
[2016-01-09 08:06:51] <Emmy B> it’s only about 6 and a half minutes
[2016-01-09 08:14:32] <Emmy B> Some of his views on the role of journalists are expressed here: http://mediaobservatory.net/investigative-journalism/rob-evans-spirit-and-attitude-main-characteristics-what-makes-good
[2016-01-09 08:14:58] <Emmy B> I have not come across specific opinion by him on WikiLeaks
[2016-01-09 08:50:07] <WISE Up Action> Thanks, it was the spiteful stuff on JA I think I had a vague memory of and thought s/one else might recall properly.
[2016-01-09 10:11:52] <Emmy B> I don’t remember him at all other than the research above but will keep an eye xx
[2016-01-09 10:14:34] <Emmy B> Monday at Going Underground RT Afshin Rattansi speaks to an Ecuadorian Minister about Saasnge’s political asylum (Monday 5 years from his first extradition hearing?) mentioned at the very end here https://www.rt.com/shows/going-underground/328358-nuclear-disaster-working-class/
[2016-01-09 22:17:20] <M> Couple year old story about Google blurring certain things in Google Maps, but I’d never come across it before. “Why, I wonder, would they do this? Especially when truTV reports they really had something to protect: “WikiLeaks did publish a diplomatic cable that confirmed the presence of nuclear warheads at this base.”” http://www.radiolab.org/story/317731-when-dutch-keep-secrets-everybody-notices-google-puzzle/
[2016-01-10 03:44:17] <Emmy B> I had 43 RTs on my Jenny Jones tweet, mostly from ppl who do not follow me, ppl are looking her name up on twitter, it is a hot subject regarding surveillance. good to link this story with the surveillance of JA/WL and police undercover infiltration too.
[2016-01-10 03:44:25] <Emmy B> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/greekemmy/status/685786438747697153
[2016-01-10 03:45:43] <Emmy B> good also to send her links with JA’s & Snowden’s speeches and interviews on the subject.
[2016-01-10 23:42:17] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/KellieTranter/status/686437338394660864 More BS from Australian Gov re JA

[2016-01-11 00:03:01] <Emmy B> As if Alexander Downer would do anything other than against WL! He has personal experience of another kind of forced transparency
[2016-01-11 00:14:32] <Emmy B> (6500 docs from his time as a UN special envoy for Cyprus were leaked to Greek Cypriot media revealing he conspired in favour of Turkish demands)
[2016-01-11 00:15:16] <Emmy B> since then his star continues to rise whilst those docs have been disappearing from the net.
[2016-01-11 00:15:52] <Emmy B> Now I read he may become next Commonwealth secretary? http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/11/alexander-downer-touted-next-secretary-general-commonwealth
[2016-01-11 00:19:55] <WikiLeaks> Downer is a sad case.
[2016-01-11 00:20:10] <WikiLeaks> Downer is a, well, downer.

[2016-01-12 10:26:49] <Emmy B> Admin ‘Maya’ from the forum (person unidentified) had started a page a couple years ago but never published it, I don’t know who wrote this page.
[2016-01-12 10:31:42] <M> Ugh. That Wikipedia page is hideous. Obviously no one is monitoring it.
[2016-01-12 10:32:34] <voidiss> It was started by someone called ‘tactik’, maybe the nickname sounds familiar to someone.
[2016-01-12 10:47:24] <Emmy B> Most of article submitted anonymously by IP : 213.167.152.107 see editing history.

[2016-01-12 10:50:25] <Emmy B> Is the FBI preparing his release from prison and ‘re-habilitation’?
[2016-01-12 11:06:05] <M> You can see the contributors here. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sigurdur_Thordarson&action=history
[2016-01-12 11:13:24] <Emmy B> I bump into it in my usual google search….Something is cooking, when is he released from prison? does anyone know?
[2016-01-12 11:20:51] <voidiss> I don’t know when he’s released.
[2016-01-12 11:21:31] <voidiss> But seems that in this period trolls’re noting that their actions are causing damages to their reputation (for ex https://twitter.com/BoltTrial2014/status/685700743760756738
[2016-01-12 11:21:36] <voidiss> Maybe they want to depict Siggy in a good light because they know they’re linked to him and they want to avoid bad publicity.
[2016-01-12 11:45:08] <M> Wondering if it’d be better to try and fix the Wiki page or to request for deletion since it’s so bad.

[2016-01-13 20:34:49] <Emmy B> MGT plans more disinfo via ‘jester’ or Louise Mensch (both very much in his timeline and have talked about it) https://archive.is/NZQQH
[2016-01-13 23:46:32] <voidiss> I used a WL cable for the NHSMUN’s position paper on Palestinian refugees and put it into the resources list. PLUSD really helped me a lot!
[2016-01-13 23:47:42] <voidiss> It allowed me to find precise info abt formal position of a small country like Côte d’Ivoire, which was rather difficult to find in the web.
[2016-01-13 23:49:45] <voidiss> Yesterday I had to send it to the Italian representative for the project and she told me to remove it b/c Americans could’ve opposed it.
[2016-01-13 23:50:14] <voidiss> (Even if the cable itself isn’t so ‘hot’, it’s unclassified even, yet she was afraid of consequences.)
[2016-01-13 23:50:56] <WikiLeaks> pathetic.
[2016-01-13 23:51:24] <voidiss> But I insisted & in the end she let me keep it. Now it’s been sent to US representatives; let’s see if they accept it or oblige me to change
[2016-01-13 23:51:48] <WikiLeaks> great. that’s a much better lesson anyway.
[2016-01-13 23:53:32] <voidiss> Indeed! Yes, it was pathetic, she quite panicked when she saw it. “Why have you put WikiLeaks in?! Do you know we’re going to the US?”.
[2016-01-13 23:53:42] <voidiss> Then when I started to argue she gave up.
[2016-01-13 23:54:50] <voidiss> By the way, being a ‘delegate’ is truly awful: you have to support the position of your country even if it’s against your own.
[2016-01-13 23:54:50] <WikiLeaks> People are so scared of everything.
[2016-01-13 23:55:56] <voidiss> (even if, well, normally delegates are chosen by the govt so it’s likely that govt and personal belief coincide, but still)
[2016-01-13 23:56:15] <WikiLeaks> It’s a fancy equivallent of working in a clothing store. Your job is to sell it, not like it.
[2016-01-13 23:57:48] <voidiss> Exactly like that! It was quite difficult to complete the position paper indeed.
[2016-01-13 23:58:09] <voidiss> Côte d’Ivoire is a bit pro-Israel, it has always been one of the most Israel/US-supportive African countries (apart from a brief period).
[2016-01-13 23:58:21] <voidiss> Therefore I was barred from proposing strong position on the Palestinian refugees problem, I had to keep a neutral/slightly pro-Israel line!
[2016-01-13 23:58:25] <WikiLeaks> The difference is, one doesn’t usually sell cardigans that promote wars.
[2016-01-13 23:59:04] <WikiLeaks> Sucks.
[2016-01-14 00:00:31] <WikiLeaks> Most countries are pro-palestine, but not the west, with a few exceptions.
[2016-01-14 00:04:54] <voidiss> Yeah, sucks a lot.
[2016-01-14 00:05:16] <voidiss> I already imagine in the SPECPOL committee, when we will have to debate, and all the other pro-Palestine Arab countries
[2016-01-14 00:05:27] <voidiss> will highlight the abuses and accuse Israel and inside me I will be screaming “YES, FUCK, YES” but my country not.
[2016-01-14 00:05:39] <voidiss> Shit, who would choose such a role?
[2016-01-14 00:08:01] <voidiss> Oh, btw. Today I have the lesson of the course about geopolitics. I will tell you how biased or unbiased it is.
[2016-01-14 00:29:03] <Emmy B> Good luck Greta! Best foot forward. Thank you for the Interesting insight.
[2016-01-14 00:40:17] <WISE Up Action> Yes, good luck Greta. It sounds a fantastic learning experience. Keep causing trouble!

[2016-01-15 10:46:21] <Emmy B> What will they do next? declare martial law in the surrounding area?
[2016-01-15 10:49:24] <Emmy B> I remember the time when due to security concerns over IRA action, parts of London where completely blocked off to traffic with armed police preventing vehicles from passing, it lasted for years.
[2016-01-15 10:51:40] <Emmy B> Considering there has been a historic bombing at Hans Crescent and with the current climate, goodness knows what they are cooking and how they will dress it.
[2016-01-15 13:33:34] <M> Interesting story: Ghana Government seeking clarification from US over Gitmo detainees it received… after reading in WikiLeaks reports that they are of “high security risk”. http://cyberattacksquad.com/gitmo-detainees-us-didnt-show-us-wikileaks-report-hanna-tetteh/

[2016-01-18 12:54:58] <M> Interesting article in NYT about how relevant people are never invited to the World Economic Forum, including JA and Snowden. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/19/business/dealbook/muting-the-global-dialogue-in-davos.html?_r=0
[2016-01-18 13:10:42] <voidiss> This article is great. About FBI surveillance on MLK and similarities with today’s debate on NSA mass spying. http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2016/01/what_the_fbi_s_surveillance_of_martin_luther_king_says_about_modern_spying.html

[2016-01-21 02:34:56] <Emmy B> The Court of Appeal in the defamation case against MGT commences this morning in Frankfurt. It will be several days/weeks before we hear of developments unless court reaches a judgement on the written evidence submitted alone. I will let ppl know here if I am asked to appear as a witness.
[2016-01-21 02:56:54] <WikiLeaks> Good luck!
[2016-01-21 02:58:35] <WikiLeaks> From our perspective, we’re interested in all the documentation that comes from that process as to MGT and his methods. We can then feed that to our lawyers with a follow up case.
[2016-01-21 03:00:44] <WISE Up Action> The FWLF in action yesterdayhttps://archive.is/HjWaz I really hope he gets what’s due. Good luck!

[2016-01-21 03:49:52] <voidiss> Fuck those Swedish assholes. They seem to enjoy playing these games with JA’s freedom.
[2016-01-21 03:50:13] <voidiss> Yesterday the news were filled with ‘in the next days’, the questioning apparently was going to happen
[2016-01-21 03:50:17] <voidiss> and today they come up again with delaying tactics. And maybe they sent the wrong format on purpose. All of this is appalling.
[2016-01-21 03:52:51] <Emmy B> Prevarication, procrastination the name of the game today. MGT lawyer did not turn up to court, no explanation.
[2016-01-21 04:58:55] <WikiLeaks> They have a history of sending the wron gformat. They did it with the UK and interpol also.
[2016-01-21 05:00:30] <WikiLeaks> Swedish prosecutors just do whatever. They’re completely unaccoutable. They’re so provicial they think the rest of the world works the same way.
[2016-01-21 05:01:45] <Emmy B> Keep your strength up, the farce is getting more and more obvious
[2016-01-21 05:04:28] <Emmy B> MGT lawyer turned up in the end, court commenced, judges will give their verdict in about six weeks.
[2016-01-21 05:06:19] <Emmy B> Who can defend Ny’s conduct in the matter? no one in their right mind!
[2016-01-21 06:54:12] <voidiss> Yes, it’s dismaying. And anyway, corrupted as they are, I really think they are not going to close the case even if they question him.
[2016-01-21 06:54:32] <voidiss> They will come up with some other crap.
[2016-01-21 09:07:49] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/m_cetera/status/690218424354672640 This is so unbelievably juvenile.
[2016-01-21 09:19:05] <Emmy B> How could it be that the Swedish Ministry of Justice and the Foreign Affairs Ministry still let Ny embarrass them in such a way as if there has not been an MLA just signed?
[2016-01-21 09:20:19] <Emmy B> and how is it Ny contents again in using a doc drafted in May 2015 before the agreement taking place and is not been ticked off about it by the Swedes themselves?
[2016-01-21 09:22:56] <Emmy B> Since the signing of the agreement Swden has de facto recognised JA’s political Asylum, they should follow through and appoint a political representative from the Ministry of Justice or Affairs in following through with the implementation of the agreement, if they have failed to do so, Ny remains a loose cannon and will embarrass them further.
[2016-01-21 09:34:08] <WikiLeaks> Ny is a loose cannon. However, they put her in charge of all rape cases in Sweden a few years ago. To knock her off puts into question every Swedish rape case in the last few years.
[2016-01-21 10:15:03] <voidiss> And given that the criticisms to the Swedish judicial system are already too many, they don’t want to lose even more reputation. The thing is that they’re losing reputation anyway, exactly thanks to this way of thinking. It’s like they are stuck into this vicious circle, oh poor them!
[2016-01-21 10:22:58] <voidiss> Anyway, today in the UN course, the woman that explained to us the rules of procedure that we will have to follow during simulation literally said that what is really important to show is that you have studied and understood how the UN system works; it’s way more fundamental “to be respectful and use the right formal rules and formulations than to speak about the actual content of the resolutions”, the issues concerning the topics, etc (in other words, those who can manipulate words and use rhetoric win, not those who highlight important aspects). She also said that we’re not here to change the world, just to prove that we’re able to have proper relations with other delegates. Verrrrry nice, isn’t it?
[2016-01-21 11:42:54] <Emmy B> There is tremendous value in understanding how the system works, learning a process, so the course is not entirely without merit but of course the person leading the course could perhaps do a slightly better job in inspiring the class, an area that from what you described is lacking.
[2016-01-21 11:46:10] <Emmy B> Frankly, if I cast my fading memory, well, 30 years back I had some inspiring teachers and some who where complete bores, it is a collective experience of secondary education perhaps?
[2016-01-21 11:51:24] <Emmy B> At least you will be able to form an informed opinion, well done for sticking with it! 🙂 let’s see what happens in the end.
[2016-01-21 12:43:10] <WikiLeaks> Litvenenko convertered to Islam.
[2016-01-21 12:43:59] <WikiLeaks> Interesting to speculate if that made Russia feel more relaxed about killinh gim.
[2016-01-21 13:14:52] <M> A few more details re questioning. Sweden resent the June 2015 application, made 6 months prior to the legal agreement with Ecuador, “and as some issues were not useful, they crossed out and sent the text with deletions”. http://www.cancilleria.gob.ec/president-correa-and-foreign-minister-patino-said-that-julian-assange-could-be-questioned-in-the-coming-days/
[2016-01-21 14:43:39] <WISE Up Action> Thanks for Litvenenko info.
[2016-01-22 01:44:49] <WISE Up Action> .http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/22/david-cameron-muslim-women
[2016-01-22 01:46:17] <WISE Up Action> Cable mentioned here: ‘colonial feminism’ ‘…..regularly repeated during the occupation as a way to justify military intervention. A CIA memo revealed by WikiLeaks advised European governments on how the suffering of Afghan women might bolster flagging public support for the occupation of Afghanistan, “initiatives that create media opportunities for Afghan women to share their stories with French, German and other European women could help to overcome pervasive scepticism in western Europe”.
[2016-01-22 02:20:31] <Emmy B> Wow very good article
[2016-01-22 02:21:28] <Emmy B> The same pressure to conform can be found in mono religious or ethnic culture
[2016-01-22 02:22:31] <Emmy B> Very good points made and indeed colonialism hidden under an feigned egalitarian agenda
[2016-01-22 02:23:18] <Emmy B> Good WL reference as well mask down
[2016-01-22 06:14:49] <LibertarianLibrarian> Enjoy the UN simulation, Greta. I did Model United Nations back in high school (yeesh, that was in the 1980s!) We acted out full sessions and debates. I remember representing Cuba in a couple of arguments, but not the substance. Still, it’s a great learning experience.
[2016-01-22 06:17:32] <LibertarianLibrarian> I’m sure even the Swedes know by now that Ny is an international embarrassment to them, but they’re stuck with her now. And she has political allies – after all, she got her position that way.
[2016-01-22 06:18:02] <LibertarianLibrarian> And yes, it
[2016-01-22 06:18:35] <LibertarianLibrarian> I agree re the article. Very interesting.

[2016-01-22 10:14:52] <M> Good to see RT es reporting “made up the charges” statement. So few people know about it, largely due to media bias & exclusion. https://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/197578-wikileaks-pruebas-policia-inventar-violacion
[2016-01-22 10:47:13] <Emmy B> Thank you for sharing, yep, good to see!.
[2016-01-23 00:32:12] <Emmy B> Very difficult to understand with Google Translate but Biden is visiting Turkey and Sabah reports Assange Dunbar and Biden so worthwhile keeping an eye on any english versions http://www.sabah.com.tr/gundem/2016/01/23/assangei-unuttu#
[2016-01-23 00:37:18] <Emmy B> and again here I think Sabah juxtaposes Biden’s statement about JA being a terrorist with Biden saying Dunbar is a hero calling him out for hypocrisy http://www.sabah.com.tr/dunya/2016/01/23/bidenden-ihanet-bildirisini-imzalayan-akademisyenlere-destek
[2016-01-23 07:22:53] <Emmy B> Here is the article in English Biden who calls Assange ‘hi-tech terrorist’ praises Dündar, facing similar charges, as ‘hero’ http://www.dailysabah.com/nation/2016/01/23/biden-who-calls-assange-hi-tech-terrorist-praises-dundar-facing-similar-charges-as-hero#

[2016-01-24 16:02:25] <voidiss> SO MUCH. And WikiLeaks will need support more than ever too.
[2016-01-24 20:50:50] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/UFOcentral/status/691481886359572480 Neat.
[2016-01-24 23:12:04] <M> Just watched the full new X-Files episode. That was the only reference to WL so far.
[2016-01-24 23:13:11] <M> It has a pretty strong anti-government control theme, which is neat, but it’s also on the premise of “because aliens!!” so not sure how helpful it is in the endgame. Damn good entertainment, though.
[2016-01-25 22:14:12] <WISE Up Action> Lovely to see JA featured briefly introing the online of Ai Weiwei Royal Academy exhibition. http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2016/january/missed-ai-weiwei-at-the-ra-now-you-can-visit-it-online/https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/ai-weiwei-360
[2016-01-25 22:16:44] <Emmy B> Yes, Lovely surprise! 🙂
[2016-01-26 03:36:16] <voidiss> Extremely interesting article on US economic/political interests in a suspension of Schengen (and an increase of data sharing), Libya,
[2016-01-26 03:36:17] <voidiss> targeted killing and propaganda through online ‘trolls brigades’: https://contraspin.co.nz/the-agenda-to-destabilize-europe/
[2016-01-26 04:19:18] <WikiLeaks> Pits it is so poorly written–overly polemic, emotional.
[2016-01-26 04:21:22] <WikiLeaks> Pity
[2016-01-26 04:40:40] <voidiss> Oh, really? I thought it was pretty good… What parts do you find too polemical/emotional?
[2016-01-26 04:52:23] <WikiLeaks> The start, but there’s too many adjectives, generally.
[2016-01-26 04:52:58] <WikiLeaks> So even though there’s good content, we can’t retweet it, because it feels too biased/ranty.
[2016-01-26 04:53:13] <WikiLeaks> i.e doesn’t feel credible, even though it is.
[2016-01-26 05:12:40] <voidiss> Uhm, got the point, it has to be more ‘neutral’. Thanks for the explanation.
[2016-01-26 05:17:53] <WikiLeaks> The problem is it feels like the author is trying to convince the reader of something–without declaring itself to be a polemic. Readers become defensive as a result and their minds close over to the factual presentation..
[2016-01-26 05:33:49] <voidiss> Got what you mean.
[2016-01-26 05:34:15] <voidiss> But so, for ex, there’re some Greenwald’s or Rixstep’s articles with a very harsh, polemical, maybe sarcastic tone, but are considered good.
[2016-01-26 05:34:35] <voidiss> Is it because they declare themselves polemics?
[2016-01-26 05:34:51] <voidiss> I’m not blaming anyone, of course, I appreciate a lot their articles. I’m simply trying to understand better.
[2016-01-26 05:41:10] <WikiLeaks> Exactly, their writing is punchier and funnier and doesn’t pretend to be primarily analytical. It also somehow gives the impression that its on the “side” of the reader in mocking power.
[2016-01-26 05:48:57] <voidiss> Okay, now it’s clear, it depends on the style you want to adopt. Thanks!
[2016-01-26 11:12:58] <Emmy B> When is Julian’s 1500 day ‘in’? Is it some time in March?
[2016-01-26 11:15:45] <Emmy B> 28/07/2016 I think
[2016-01-26 11:59:42] <M> Yes, depending on how you count it’s would be 27th or 28th.
[2016-01-26 12:03:45] <M> Sooner date to note would be 2000 days detained, on 28/29 May.

[2016-01-30 06:40:56] <Bean> JANUARY 21, 2016
Ecuador requests Sweden submit a new application. Swedish prosecution issues press release hinting that now it is re-considering whether it will question Assange after all.
[2016-01-30 09:48:38] <M> New Hillary email release. Only found 8 which mention WL (with a couple from the same discussions). Interestingly, the emails from last release which originally lacked subjects now have them. But these new ones do not.

[2016-02-01 00:23:48] <Emmy B> the play is by no means promoting terrorism but exploring the most recent greek history.

Yes, there will be a vigil outside the Ecuadorian Embassy in solidarity with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks from 1pm (probably till about 3.30) this Friday with reference to the UNWGAD decision due to be announced on Friday.
I have cc’d this to Emmy, who will be co-ordinating the vigil, and will be there on the day.

[2016-02-04 14:50:05] <Matt Watt> Ok, thanks for the info. I will discuss with the Sydney group if any actions planned, all sounds a bit unknown still.

[2016-02-04 15:10:04] <Emmy B> Excellent resources!
[2016-02-04 15:23:28] <WISE Up Action> Meanwhile the turgid up-their-own-arseholes-cant-see-the-wood-for-the-trees British (sooo British) legal ‘commentators’ are scratching their dull heads for the sawdust of which sub-section of which section of which Jarndyce v Jarndyce precedent the panel can possibly have ‘relied on’ to arrive at their conclusion, swapping theories, interspersed w caustic ‘wit’ (NOT). (Assange more ‘wit’ in his little finger!) omg! I couldn’t resist a peek, but it’s #souldeath, truly…
[2016-02-04 15:45:05] <voidiss> Speak of the devil, and here comes Guardian’s lovely and soooo intelligent and well-argumented view that Julian’s ‘arbitrary detention’ is a publicity stunt. #Souldeath for real. http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/04/the-guardian-view-on-julian-assange-no-victim-of-arbitrary-detention?CMP=share_btn_tw
[2016-02-04 15:47:05] <voidiss> Oh, and never forget that when he sent his submission in 2014, “Assange knew the outcome in advance”!
[2016-02-04 15:51:14] <WISE Up Action> Oh yes! And there we have the magic mantra words ‘due process’ at the very beginning. Moreover, it’s an ‘opinion’ nobody in particular is prepared to own…o dear lord they are just so tedious

[2016-02-04 15:57:48] <voidiss> Oh, they are, indeed. And then there is this line: “No doubt the conditions of his self-imprisonment are unpleasant; they are certainly severely limiting” and I actually have homicidal instincs right now. It sounds like the patronizing and dismissive pat on the back that parents give the kid when they know he’s playing up for nothing. And this is disgusting. I want them to try, try to spend three years in such a condition and suffer as he’s suffering and then I want them to write this piece again under my eyes. Bastards.
[2016-02-04 16:01:28] <Bean> i see they closed the comments section on that one pretty fast

[2016-02-04 16:02:32] <WISE Up Action> They are two sep comments!!
[2016-02-04 16:03:47] <WikiLeaks> If we ever had any doubt that the Guardian continues, under Kath Viner, to be a vile Blairite hack-rag too close to MI6 today’s editorial removed it.
[2016-02-04 16:05:23] <WISE Up Action> They ooze lives that have never left a totally predictable track
[2016-02-04 16:05:30] <voidiss> Definitely.

[2016-02-04 16:09:40] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/m_cetera/status/695394722844508165 It is really something how they don’t even attempt to mask their vileness. They make no hesitation in publishing something that is a blatant and hypocritical hit piece.
[2016-02-04 16:11:22] <voidiss> They are really the apotheosis of the sneaky pro-establishment MSM because they play the part of the liberal ones! Yes, they seem blatantly pathetic to us because we know very well, but they seem ok and even cool to average people. They are like the Hillary of the media.
[2016-02-04 16:12:01] <WISE Up Action> no room for doubts questions or anyone who gets in the way – the image of the other one – Rusbridger – playing that bloody piano for weeks…
[2016-02-04 16:12:03] <WISE Up Action> Some of those comments just odd. Robotic. Like a dodgy b&b owner writing his own review on Tripadvisor.
[2016-02-04 16:16:15] <WISE Up Action> The true pharisees
[2016-02-04 16:35:15] <WikiLeaks> It’s not just publishing a hit piece. It is THE editorial. i.e the Guardian’s management position.
[2016-02-04 16:40:56] <voidiss> In a perfect world, journalists upon journalists would resign from the Guardian after such a shameful editorial.

[2016-02-05 01:38:58] <M> A lot of people ignoring the fact that arbitrary detention refers to Dec 2010 onward, not just in embassy. Sweden, media have both commented on just embassy detention.
[2016-02-05 01:41:24] <Emmy B> good point!
[2016-02-05 01:42:24] <Emmy B> The EAW for ‘questioning’ is also challenged and UK parliament has acknowledged injustice and changed the law!
[2016-02-05 01:47:00] <voidiss> Indeed!
[2016-02-05 01:47:18] <voidiss> “The Working Group considered that Mr. Assange has been subjected to different forms of deprivation of liberty:
[2016-02-05 01:47:22] <voidiss> initial detention in Wandsworth prison which was followed by house arrest and his confinement at the Ecuadorian Embassy.”

[2016-02-05 08:44:01] <M> Here is the statement from Fritz: http://www.wral.com/the-latest-sweden-says-un-statement-has-no-legal-effect/15322847/
[2016-02-05 08:49:59] <Emmy B> A supporter or ‘supporter’ has thrown a bag on the balcony with a present for JA
[2016-02-05 08:50:13] <Emmy B> Pls have security check it
[2016-02-05 08:50:39] <Emmy B> A black gent smartly dressed
[2016-02-05 08:51:00] <Emmy B> A police ifficer had a word with him
[2016-02-05 08:52:45] <voidiss> Oh my god.
[2016-02-05 08:52:57] <Emmy B> [Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/695651334255702019/695651334293430273/EIbwD8X5.jpg
[2016-02-05 08:53:44] <Emmy B> The police is ringing on the embassy now
[2016-02-05 08:55:15] <WISE Up Action> ‘On another point, meanwhile, is there a bit of a tell in the fact that Assange has not petitioned the European court of human rights on the arbitrary detention angle up to this point?’ says Marina in her gollum. What a twat.
[2016-02-05 08:55:55] <Emmy B> I have removed it
[2016-02-05 08:57:58] <voidiss> Oh, well done. God, that’s disturbing.
[2016-02-05 08:58:04] <voidiss> Were the police ringing because of that?
[2016-02-05 09:36:58] <LibertarianLibrarian> The embassy security should handle it. Just to be sure of Julian’s safety. I suppose if it was something bad, the police could arrest the thrower, but I doubt it’s worth that.
[2016-02-05 09:37:00] <WISE Up Action> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/WISEUpAction/status/695662114963374085 Another illuminating post from Craig

[2016-02-05 09:54:15] <LibertarianLibrarian> Craig Murray is always solid and on-point.
[2016-02-05 11:04:23] <voidiss> Wow, Craig Murray is going strong today: https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/02/philip-hammonds-astonishing-lie/
[2016-02-05 11:17:14] <WISE Up Action> That bag-thrower guy *seemed* to be well intentioned but just very impulsive and always pushing things. Stupid thing to do. Hope nothing more behind it.
[2016-02-05 13:11:51] <Emmy B> I videoed the person who tried to disrupt JA’s speech, a fake charity worker collecting money in a bucket, wearing a funny Union Jack hat.
[2016-02-05 13:17:04] <Emmy B> I confronted him and he momentarily went away, after the speech was over he came up to me to say ‘sorry I did not have anything against the guy but someone put 50 GBP in the bucket and asked me to do it, I did it for the children, I don’t care where you are going to put the video” He shook my hand, no hard feelings etc. I don’t think he was truthful, in what he said anyway, later he had a large plastic bin bag and went around collecting all the rubbish left on the scene by the reporters, coffee cups etc. He was the second individual who tried to disrupt, for the first one, I complained to a police officer and twitted his photo, he did not bother us after that.
[2016-02-05 13:17:58] <Emmy B> Plenty of interesting lessons in this journey.
[2016-02-05 13:21:38] <LibertarianLibrarian> I wouldn’t be surprised if someone paid the guy to be disruptive. But, yes, I agree he’s not likely a real charity worker. Good job handling both individuals.
[2016-02-05 13:22:41] <LibertarianLibrarian> I was so happy to see you all there on the video and photos! I’ve been with you in heart and mind, even though I’m stuck working through a blizzard here. Wish me luck driving home in the mess.
[2016-02-05 13:24:02] <LibertarianLibrarian> So happy to see Julian looking so well, though that cough he was fighting made me a little bit concerned. It’s just so obscene he can’t get proper medical care in this situation.
[2016-02-05 13:37:48] <Emmy B> Thank you Jenny, it was a bit intimidating when I first arrived with all the crowds of reporters but as more and more supporters arrived, things got better and better, in the end, we had a great time and what a treat to have Julian among us, and see he is looking well and share this moment of triumph! Onwards and Upwards 🙂
[2016-02-05 13:39:19] <Emmy B> Good Luck driving back, do you put chains on your wheels to drive through snow over there?
[2016-02-05 14:24:21] <WISE Up Action> Your Anon Central at it again ugh! And what’s this??! On their ‘profile’ – ‘We support the weak against the powerful. Honest wholesome opinions, motivational uplifting tweets AND (ha ha ha, what a giveaway) -> ‘sound financial advice’.

[2016-02-05 16:28:32] <WISE Up Action> Excellent. That Dinah person has made some fantastic statements – the last two 19th June’s for instance
[2016-02-05 17:22:44] <WISE Up Action> Am I being picky if I think ‘“I’m absolutely convinced that [the panel] has been put under very strong political pressure,” he said ‘ does not quite equate to ‘We were put under ‘strong political pressure’ by US & UK to subvert judgement’ ? though I see it undoubtedly has the sense of it..
[2016-02-05 17:25:12] <WISE Up Action> Just concerned about the bloke himself saying he was misquoted or something? Mares nests etc
[2016-02-05 17:42:53] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/9NewsAdel/status/695774196857749504 Pulling out all the smears from the ol’ smear bag.
[2016-02-05 18:24:00] <LibertarianLibrarian> Sounds wonderful, Emmy!
[2016-02-05 18:26:26] <LibertarianLibrarian> It’s amazing how many so -called journalists are rushing to smear Julian. It’s a sick combination of egotism, fear, bowing to power, and jealousy.
[2016-02-05 18:28:19] <M> It is amazing how, while already having an extremely low opinion of the UK press, I can still be blown away by how truly terrible it is.
[2016-02-05 18:30:38] <LibertarianLibrarian> The same here. I’m at the point that if I’m stuck in a waiting room somewhere with ‘news’ on, I cringe and try to avoid hearing it.

[2016-02-06 02:15:33] <voidiss> Btw, I deeply agree with you both regarding the media. I’ve already reached the point at which I completely lost faith in MSM
[2016-02-06 02:15:38] <voidiss> I’m totally disillusioned about them and yet, yet I still find myself aghast at certain things, even if I expect them.
[2016-02-06 02:20:56] <WISE Up Action> Such as difference with press at embassy yesterday: many foreign press engaged and interested in case and in supporters, UK drones in full smartarse mode.

[2016-02-06 04:27:11] <WISE Up Action> Em he and Bob (vigiler) were squaring up at one point and I managed to get this guy away. He was saying the same stuff about costs, but when set him straight he seemed quite reasonable – shook my hand etc. don’t know what he was actually doing, collecting money / picking up rubbish etc, he just kept coming back and blundering in. There was another guy with him up near Harrods. Some people just like cameras I think!
[2016-02-06 04:33:17] <Emmy B> Who paid him though to act in this way? and why be a willing actor to disrupt our efforts? Jim Curran who saw the affair from afar has confirmed to me the heckler is known in the area. And the efforts of ‘reconciliation’ also an attempt to influence my perception of him so I dismiss his behaviour as a blip and not expose him in a video. I don’t expect MI5/MetPol Uni graduates to stoop so low as to dress up in a ridiculous hat and parade in this manner it is the willing stooges they use.
[2016-02-06 04:37:04] <Emmy B> What this man was saying was identical to what the other ‘gentleman’ who looked like Alexander Downer (hehe) tried to do earlier I again confronted him and reported him to a police officer and twitted his photo as Mr Agitator. Having stood outside the embassy for so long I am aware that it is extremely rare to have members of the public behave in this manner towards JA’s case. And to have two at the precise day and time pop up saying the same things? it is not normal.
[2016-02-06 04:51:49] <WISE Up Action> True. Don’t know why he kept coming back for another go. There did seem to be few strange characters around.
[2016-02-06 05:55:56] <Emmy B> And here is the other guy who attempted to disrupt the vigil https://youtu.be/RXvH8Br_ybU

[2016-02-06 11:27:08] <WISE Up Action> The legal commentary on WGAD seems so predictable and funneled down the usual parochial yet superior mindsets (so very set set set.) Again, just unable to see the wood for the trees. ‘Filtering out gnats and swallowing camels’ springs to mind. This is the same old stuff – national legalese vs Intl Human Rights Law. It’s an ongoing fight that has much wider repercussions ofc. The ignorance is mindbending.

[2016-02-06 11:32:19] <WikiLeaks> Yes. We may have set up an historic shift. The Uniting of UK+Sweden+US together with Iran, China and Russia against the UN human rights system.

[2016-02-06 16:19:28] <Emmy B> we constantly make new law, hopefully always improving it and not going the wrong direction. To see law legalistically (Gardener) is to strip it from its goal which is Justice. He serves up an unpalatable dish.

[2016-02-07 03:19:50] <voidiss> SW’s criticism of the ruling spreads: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/julian-assange-rape-victim-criticises-un-decision-over-detention-a6857796.html
[2016-02-07 03:20:51] <M> Yes. Articles have been misleading because all quotes come from Fritz’ statement.
[2016-02-07 03:21:53] <WISE Up Action> Yes rehashing Fritz.
[2016-02-07 03:22:53] <voidiss> Indeed. Apart from the “I want vindication” one, but I smell set-up statement.
[2016-02-07 03:23:20] <WISE Up Action> Yes that’s a very odd phrase.
[2016-02-07 03:24:45] <voidiss> We know how it works: http://rixstep.com/1/20130614,01.shtml
[2016-02-07 03:25:39] <M> I mean, it is all third-party. The entirety is a statement from Fritz — none of it is a first-hand quote from SW.

[2016-02-07 06:16:14] <M> Thanks, Emmy. So there it is, UK papers refusing to cover stories they don’t like. Really makes you trust them, doesn’t it?
[2016-02-07 06:23:53] <voidiss> This is one of the most stupid excuses ever. You don’t want to base your report on Assange/lawyers “opinions”, as she says?
[2016-02-07 06:24:19] <voidiss> Well, set it up in a different way, expressing your view on the news or something.
[2016-02-07 06:24:35] <voidiss> But saying ‘we don’t report because there’s blanket coverage based on JA opinions’ is utterly stupid, let alone untrue
[2016-02-07 06:24:40] <voidiss> b/cos defining that smearing coverage by MSM the reflection of ‘Assange personalities and opinion’ is ridiculously absurd.
[2016-02-07 06:24:56] <voidiss> *personality
[2016-02-07 06:43:21] <WikiLeaks> Fritz has a statement in the metro in Sweden. We can see no reference to SW saying anything there and are suspicious. There are three possibilities 1. UK journalists spun fritz to make it look like it was SW. 2. fritz egged them on to do that by making misleading statements or falsifications or SW told fritz “do whatever”. 3. fritz talked SW into the quote
[2016-02-07 06:48:30] <WikiLeaks> But it’s important to tackle the SW falsehoods by going back to her original statements about being railroaded etc. The transition to the current claims can only be explained by duress (the ‘railroaded’ / police made it up / refusal to sign events) or by inducements. We haven’t wanted to push it for strategic reasons but there are SMSs that refer to borgstrom making cash inducements to SW that first week, where he says he’s brokering deals and SW bragging to a friend about how she can get cash.
[2016-02-07 06:53:08] <WikiLeaks> We have wanted to permit an escape route for SW; pointing out that she was bragging about cash offers coming from borgstrom makes her look evil, which offers no easy escape and makes the narrative more complex.
[2016-02-07 06:53:55] <WikiLeaks> But it looks like we might be forced into it.
[2016-02-07 06:59:58] <voidiss> God, the case would really fall immediately if Ny handed the SMSs over. That’s a blatant corruption attempt.
[2016-02-07 07:00:37] <voidiss> Anyway, imho, you’ve made the right choice by not exposing her and it’d be better if you keep this line, because MSM is only waiting for you
[2016-02-07 07:00:47] <voidiss> to do something they can twist as ‘harrassment against the women’ (even if OBVIOUSLY this wouldn’t be the case).
[2016-02-07 07:00:58] <voidiss> Anyway, it’s weird that no journo (apart from Valenti) has ever tried to get an interview with the two women or SW alone.
[2016-02-07 07:01:25] <Emmy B> Alex Gibney

[2016-02-07 07:03:04] <voidiss> Oh, right. Forgot about that.
[2016-02-07 07:03:15] <WikiLeaks> Surely many have tried. They realise that it’s not in their interest. Better to hide behind the state.

[2016-02-07 07:47:55] <Emmy B> Very good coverage from Al Jazeera, I asked Peter Tatchell to participate as Al Jazeera had reached out to us via Wise Up. He very kindly agreed.
[2016-02-07 08:13:21] <WISE Up Action> Poor man rebranded as a ‘WiseUp’ campaigner!
[2016-02-07 08:43:44] <Emmy B> He did not mind one bit, we got on really well and shared an energy bar, he was famished poor guy. I explained I haven’t much experience speaking in front of 40+ journos so he took the loudspeaker asked me the name of our group and started of ‘we from wise up etc etc’ I remember seeing him at the century club in support of Chelsea Manning a few years back. He asked whether Jemima Khan and Vivien Westwood had visited, I said VW had been reported to visit the day before and that Jemima is no longer a friend.
[2016-02-07 08:55:31] <WISE Up Action> Yes, he’s done quite of lot of Chelsea stuff with us, and always stepped up. It always amazes me that there are people who haven’t heard of him, though – he’s been around forever and in the news since the 70s. What he said was good. He works so hard too.
[2016-02-07 10:03:06] <WikiLeaks> Good work on that Emmy. PT was wanting to help.

[2016-02-07 10:58:21] <Emmy B> I will watch later, busy responding to Birgit Maass of DW about the 44 ppl interviewed in UK by Sweden etc. Considering I am on the witness list for the court case against him anything he says and does may be later reported as witness harassment, and I will treat it as such. 10th of March we should know the court’s deliberation on the case and we will act accordingly.
[2016-02-07 10:59:48] <Emmy B> @Cabledrum, if you could make a recording of it I would be grateful, still have not managed to learn how to download videos.
[2016-02-07 11:23:42] <Emmy B> @M don’t worry, it is one of my own videos which I have uploaded they have reloaded it with a different title and summary, Not to worry, I thought you meant they had made their own video, ie they were there. I am not concerned about this one but thanks very much for keeping an eye 🙂
[2016-02-07 11:24:31] <M> Ah, I see. I hadn’t realized — I was under the same impression as you. Thanks for checking it out, though!

[2016-02-07 22:26:20] <M> Re-reading the NYT editorial, it’s actually quite positive.
[2016-02-07 23:56:36] <voidiss> Yes, agree. It puts in that same old skeptical tone, but it’s rather ok.
[2016-02-07 23:57:11] <voidiss> On the other hand, the other one in NYTOpinion is really bullshit; the author seems really a pro-govt reactionary conservative that
[2016-02-07 23:57:28] <voidiss> thinks democracy must come with compromises for our freedom (which philosophically would also be interesting
[2016-02-07 23:57:42] <voidiss> to discuss, yes – what democracy really means etc -, but not in the way he puts it, not claiming that WL wants to back Russia!).
[2016-02-07 23:58:12] <voidiss> He keeps repeating that WL did a great job (and likely he says so b/cos he wanna cover his ass) but then he states that govt has rights
[2016-02-07 23:58:18] <voidiss> to keep info from citizens etc. And GOD, claming there’s no public interest in CIA emails is so outrageous, they talk about torture!

[2016-02-08 08:57:54] <WISE Up Action> Anyone have any views on that?

[2016-02-08 12:03:29] <Emmy B> Does this mean there was contact between MetPol and North American government body relating JA in 2012?
[2016-02-08 12:54:54] <M> It doesn’t sound that way to me. How did you come to that conclusion?
[2016-02-08 12:55:46] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/ecotricity/status/695607135388958721 This is a bit odd and amusing. A UK energy company tweeted in support of the UNWGAD and received some serious backlash (see thread to tweet)
[2016-02-08 13:01:34] <WISE Up Action> M: wow! And they stood their ground in that response to a complaint.
[2016-02-08 13:04:16] <WISE Up Action> Very strange backdrop.
[2016-02-08 13:08:44] <WISE Up Action> It is #ridiculous that people are incapable of reading what’s actually there! And they just can’t see they respond to what they’ve imagined in their twaddly heads! The email reply is great.

[2016-02-09 04:31:29] <WISE Up Action> On the Liora Lazarus piece there’s also a comment from Mads Andenas, who must be actively ‘raising awareness’ by the looks of it…
[2016-02-09 04:49:19] <Emmy B> excellent!
[2016-02-09 05:49:08] <WISE Up Action> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/WISEUpAction/status/697053972532744192 Here’s another interview he’s done – bless him! He’ll have to watch his back…Just done impromptu translation based on google translate turned into English
[2016-02-09 05:52:28] <WISE Up Action> Stefania said she’ll check trans. later – but do you want to have a look, Greta, or are you busy. I think he goes even further with this one. He’s very angry I think?
[2016-02-09 06:09:17] <voidiss> I’ve read the article and wow, this interview is gold – he clearly defines the actions of UK and Sweden and service for the US
[2016-02-09 06:09:40] <voidiss> and insists a lot on the almost certain preasures they endured. Re the translation, it seems coherent with the original to me.
[2016-02-09 06:09:56] <voidiss> Just, when you say “no one will thank you”, it should be “thank them”.
[2016-02-09 06:10:13] <voidiss> And here: “England has reacted in the same way in which they react to nations to which do not want to be compared”
[2016-02-09 06:10:15] <voidiss> it should be more “England has reacted in the same way in which nations to which they do not want to be compared react”.
[2016-02-09 06:18:13] <WISE Up Action> Thanks, Greta! I have slightly adjusted some other things now – could you have a look? Re ‘no one will thank you’ – that is a common English expression that fits even in referring to a third party so I’m not sure what he actually said there…do you still think I should change that?

[2016-02-09 08:02:17] <voidiss> Sorry, I was out, I’m taking a look now. Regarding that ‘thank you’, ops, I didn’t know it’s a specific English expression. The literal meaning in Italian is exactly referring to a third party, so it’s ok.
[2016-02-09 08:03:29] <voidiss> [Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/697088438433157124/697088438588350464/EaYfsUrz.jpg I don’t know if you did it on purpuse, but I note that you left out this part, which in English would be: “He’s member of some of the most prestigious academic institutions of law, like the Oxford University’s “Institute of European and Comparative Law”, and he’s visiting professor at the university “La Sapienza”. He tells l’Espresso how hard it is for the Working Group to issue critical judgements against countries like the US, the UK or Sweden, generally considered to respect human rights.”
[2016-02-09 08:20:19] <WISE Up Action> Oh, no – I did it really quickly – don’t know how that got left out. Thanks – I’ll add it now x

[2016-02-09 08:56:11] <M> FYI: Here’s a list of all tweets made by UK MPs mentioning JA/WL after UNWGAD announcement. Obviously, it is largely negative. http://pastebin.com/K7nmYmuv
[2016-02-09 09:02:20] <Emmy B> not good but perspective: only 20 MP signed Caroline Lucas EDM1021 in support of David Miranda/Sarah Harrison and against Schedule 7 of the terrorism act.
[2016-02-09 09:09:57] <WISE Up Action> They are so appalling – all perceptions; no fact checking at all. A real disgrace.
[2016-02-09 09:17:55] <Bean> note to WL: if you save and use the full size image of the infographics, then they’ll expand when clicked on – easier to read 🙂
[2016-02-09 09:18:09] <Emmy B> Whilst establishment is admiring its own peacock feathers they are actually arrogantly showing their worst self. It will back fire. I predict the legal establishment (am not talking about the DAG bottom of the barrel types) will be the first to capitulate to a new approach to JAs case because this political/MSM co-ordinated bullying and Hammond’s disregard for UN ruling is a slap on the face of any legal framework. The more obvious is the political interference on a legal matters and their interference is unfolding most eloquently in front of our eyes the last few days, the more voices within the legal system will have to pull them back somehow, these are establishment subgroups in a tug of war between themselves for power. Yes politicians can bestow favour among the judges and Lords but disregarding/disrespecting UNWGAD the politicians slap the face of this country’s legal establishment. The UK establishment has said far too much on the subject, in a show of power and the more they say the better.
[2016-02-09 09:24:37] <WISE Up Action> I think that’s sound, Em. The more disrespectful they are, the more hubris. And, though vile and very unfair to JA, sometimes any publicity is good. Good people look into it when the establishment ‘protests too much’. And then they publicise the truth.
[2016-02-09 09:26:44] <WISE Up Action> Thanks for that advice abt infographics, Bean – wondered why they didn’t perform when ‘snatched’!

[2016-02-09 22:26:10] <WISE Up Action> That’s great. V. interesting to see Caroline Luv
[2016-02-09 22:27:06] <WISE Up Action> Lucas sitting in the middle of a rapturous greeting of JA, Hope it makes her think.
[2016-02-09 23:03:59] <Emmy B> yes
[2016-02-09 23:05:30] <Emmy B> I did not see her clapping but maybe I missed it.
[2016-02-09 23:26:24] <WISE Up Action> She looked conflicted. She was doing the same as everyone else but less – smiling and clapping but a little less (but that at’s all speculation, really I suppose). I think it’s good she was in an environment so very different from the oh so narrow British liberal scene and was forced to see how different people’s attitude is.
[2016-02-09 23:28:28] <WISE Up Action> If you never looked away from this country, you might forget that JA is a hero to the rest of the world..so it’s good she got reminded!
[2016-02-09 23:48:00] <Emmy B> Thanks for the video M! you are right W she did clap and yes Westminster is so out of touch with what matters… or sometimes reality even…watching a good part of the debate to bomb Syria in 2015 the word ‘Cyprus’ never featured, one could have thought the planes where taking off from air bases in the UK and not from a small, country, half an hour’s flight from ME, occupied by 40,000 Turkish Troops (the same Turkey that assists Daesh) but Westminster conveniently ignores this reality leading the entire country in this parallel reality immune from responsibility through ignorance of the truth.
[2016-02-09 23:51:03] <Emmy B> JA very much hit the nail on the head I thought with the references to War, destabilisation in EU, Shenken and losing sight of European interests. I now read Merkel’s visit to Turkey brings home Erdogan’s request for NATO’s involvement in Refugee management in the Aegean. The ultimate anathema.
[2016-02-09 23:58:10] <Emmy B> Nato became an instrument of acquiescence used by US to pressure Greece to accept the Turkish invasion and occupation of Cyprus in 1974 on the pretext of holding stable the South Eastern flank of Nato. Prime Minister Karamanlis freshly returned from self exile in Paris, heading the newly restored post junta government removed Greece from Nato (albeit partly) in protest. So Nato must never be the guarantor of EU’s soil or sea especially when it already sanctions and supports a Nato member illegally occupying Cyprus an EU member.
[2016-02-09 23:59:17] <Emmy B> I see Nato in this respect the auctioneer of EU interests to outside interests to serve short term misguided US interests in the region.
[2016-02-10 14:55:06] <WikiLeaks> EU’s weakness can be see clearly when looking at its recent negoiation with Turkey over refugees
[2016-02-10 15:24:00] <Emmy B> yes
[2016-02-10 15:24:47] <Emmy B> still many die almost daily
[2016-02-10 15:35:08] <Emmy B> it worries me what JA said about the long night
[2016-02-10 19:38:17] <WISE Up Action> Yes. And as he intimates, the lack of vision is the heart of it. It’s so bankrupt. Without vision, there’s nothing – let alone anything sufficient to counter the evil.

[2016-02-11 10:28:32] <voidiss> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/JasonLeopold/status/697844146367627265 Great!
[2016-02-11 11:20:59] <WISE Up Action> The LRB piece not too bad as a whole, but his main point is predicated on the oft touted (and of course totally erroneous) idea that the releases ceased after Cablegate. Research research! They just don’t do any, do they?! Just a simple visit to WLs home page – and they can’t stretch to it – so slack.
[2016-02-11 11:26:25] <M> Right. It read like a sneaky attack piece to me. That point especially, “And, after all, when he ran out of secrets, his image was all he had left”, and referring to JA as a “black hole”.
[2016-02-11 11:40:07] <WISE Up Action> Yes, I know. Just that there is some positive info in it and LRB readers will now be in receipt of that. But it’s true it appears quite personal about both of them – more so about Ai Wei Wei I think. That he thinks the beach shot isn’t recognisable amazes me. To me that image was shockingly, instantly recognisable, and an important reminder of the issues, though he’s got a lot of flack for it not being ‘sensitive’ and this bloke seems to be capitalising on that.

[2016-02-12 00:36:17] <WISE Up Action> Actually Em, have noticed a few, not many, but a few, Swedes starting to get interested in case and asking questions – obviously since WGAD but since getting Ny’s profile raised more generally. Historically Swedes on our TL tended to troll, but nothing recently and only ‘pro’ activity. Small but may be something. (D)
[2016-02-12 00:41:00] <Emmy B> thanks D, I kind fell off my chair reading this
[2016-02-12 00:43:20] <Emmy B> interesting opening remark ‘would have kept my mouth shut but…’ it seems this what Swedes do in the case and of course the fear of a law suit referenced in the end is also interesting

[2016-02-12 15:42:37] <Emmy B> It might be just a news aggregator site.
[2016-02-12 23:18:55] <M> @wikileaks_forum is gone now
[2016-02-12 23:43:28] <WISE Up Action> Good news. Wonder what there game is tho?
[2016-02-12 23:56:01] <Emmy B> We have Chris to thank
[2016-02-12 23:58:48] <Emmy B> Last timeline saved for the curious: http://archive.is/VOeBz
[2016-02-13 00:06:41] <Emmy B> A couple of weeks ago I wrote this http://greekemmy.com/2016/01/30/mark-goeder-tarant-is-the-owner-of-the-fake-wikileaks-forum/
[2016-02-13 00:09:39] <Emmy B> This account deletion may be temporary
[2016-02-13 00:11:19] <Emmy B> Without being an expert, account holders can recover accounts within 30 days of deletion.
[2016-02-13 00:53:45] <SAWC Sydney> after the 30days should we create a account and take the Twitter handle? so they can’t use?
[2016-02-13 01:10:37] <Emmy B> He’s just cleaning his timeline or removing temporarily pending court case result he has not given up @supportJAdotcom for example
[2016-02-13 01:15:17] <WISE Up Action> I doubt he will stay away too long, Em. Good to have those ‘Twiitter bad / FB good’ tweets of his – can throw back at him in time. But yes, nicking the account name after 30 days would be a nice touch!
[2016-02-13 06:05:06] <LibertarianLibrarian> Would be nice to steal away the account name, though Emmy’s probably right about this being temporary ass-covering. But we can always hope some of the court cases are putting some fear of being caught into what little brain he has.
[2016-02-13 06:47:26] <WikiLeaks> It very much looks like a setup.
[2016-02-13 06:47:56] <WikiLeaks> Either in relation to the court case or an active Twitter policy dispute.
[2016-02-13 06:49:22] <WikiLeaks> We should not go after the facebook group
[2016-02-13 06:49:27] <WikiLeaks> not=now
[2016-02-13 06:49:44] <WikiLeaks> Is anyone monitoring that?
[2016-02-13 06:58:44] <WikiLeaks> @AssangeNews appears to be a huffpost asset.
[2016-02-13 07:01:06] <M> She was referring to this account: @JulianAssngeNws
[2016-02-13 07:02:49] <M> Doesn’t look malicious, though.

[2016-02-13 07:04:17] <M> FYI, new Hillary emails are supposed to be out today, but nothing as of yet.
[2016-02-13 07:09:30] <WISE Up Action> So the German WLF is back up.
[2016-02-13 07:12:57] <voidiss> Well, if now his policy is trying to hide evidence of his behaviour, deleting of the Twitter account and keeping the FB page is in line. The page seems more ‘mild-mannered’, there are no bad insults or stalking of supporters, even if they still link to the same forum posts and negative articles.
[2016-02-13 09:23:48] <WikiLeaks> Can someone look to see what other wikileaksforum type accounts there are?
[2016-02-13 09:24:03] <WikiLeaks> Now he’s being pushed to the margins we need to occupy the support centre.
[2016-02-13 10:18:37] <M> Latest Hillary emails out:
Highly redacted email during the time of the Afghan War Logs publication and the State Dept attempting to figure out what’s happening. Email went out to huge list of contacts. Can feel the urgency.

[2016-02-13 10:29:27] <Emmy B> How common is it that a Swedish person writing in English will write the word shocking as ‘chocking’?
[2016-02-13 10:29:48] <voidiss> He’s already back. https://twitter.com/wikileaks_forum/status/698573393659084800
[2016-02-13 10:30:38] <Emmy B> I have seen it in SW MSM texts I think in JA’s Affidavid and I just saw it somewhere else.
[2016-02-13 10:59:54] <M> And WLF is gone again. If he couldn’t last 24 hours without making a comment, I don’t think he’ll last long being away.
[2016-02-13 11:11:45] <Emmy B> Agree. Just games, and enjoying it. There are many things going on legally etc, we have to be very patient.
[2016-02-13 11:59:28] <Emmy B> [Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/698597378031534083/698597378048290816/fF7xidY8.png I have started analysing MGT FB pages. Came across this interaction between MGT and…
[2016-02-13 12:02:42] <Emmy B> Now I am not going to throw my toy out of the pram but however hard I have tried MGT’s ability to deceive has been beyond me.
[2016-02-13 12:05:44] <Emmy B> This interaction which we just see could have led to FB messages btw the 2 and eventually MGT’s tactic of making ppl say the wrong thing (a tactic I saw numerous times) and then use it to create discourse, distrust, embarrassment and alienation could have damaged a person’s goodwill towards WL/JA.
[2016-02-13 12:11:31] <Emmy B> Once I do an updated post on all the FB pages I will Tweet to Kevin about it. The interaction is from 2013 and seeing the his willingness to share info with ‘Sunshine press’ let’s hope he has not shared anything else, considering his position. grumph!
[2016-02-13 12:14:13] <WISE Up Action> Em, yes is it worth tweeting a warning message about FWLF people moving to FB and being wary of approaches there?
[2016-02-13 12:15:33] <Emmy B> I am currently reviewing. I already had published a post about all MGT wikileaks related pseudo pages.
[2016-02-13 12:16:35] <WISE Up Action> OK.
[2016-02-13 12:16:38] <Emmy B> I have not tweeted that old post as yet so as not to alert him to the fact I am researching them, and he changes stuff.
[2016-02-13 12:18:47] <Emmy B> As I am not using tor he will be tracing my IP anyway every time I visit his site to pick up threads for archiving, he probably knows it is me, he has so few real visitors but…hehehe I am in Lisbon at the mo so he’ll be wondering 🙂
[2016-02-13 21:20:43] <Cabledrum> The closure of @wikileaks_forum is a very strange development. I have no idea what the reason for it could be. I can’t imagine that MGT would ever give up this Twitter account voluntarily.
[2016-02-13 21:20:50] <Cabledrum> FWLF have reduced their activities on FB substantially in the past years. They only did approx. 300 FB posts last year, in contrast to more than 30,000 tweets.
[2016-02-13 21:21:16] <Cabledrum> MGT still has a number of FB pages but most of them seem to be abandoned. Beside https://www.facebook.com/wikileaksforumhttps://www.facebook.com/WikiLeaks.SunshinePress
[2016-02-14 00:35:42] <Emmy B> I agree, and although one can’t know for sure what he is up to, I think it links to his legal troubles, with the defamation court ruling scheduled for 10th of March.
[2016-02-14 00:38:16] <Emmy B> In other news Frazens ‘Purit y’ which was unfavourable for JA to be basis for 20 part series. http://www.avclub.com/article/daniel-craig-might-star-jonathan-franzen-tv-show-s-232219
[2016-02-14 01:07:00] <M> Not sure what’s going on here: @wikileakz_forum
[2016-02-14 01:29:19] <Emmy B> I just took a look and the account retweeted my tweet Paranoid much?
[2016-02-14 01:30:13] <Emmy B> He is trolling us & loves the attention?
[2016-02-14 01:36:09] <Emmy B> Let’s see if he bites

[2016-02-14 01:46:32] <Emmy B> OR someone else trolls him which would be the MEGA LOL 🙂
[2016-02-14 01:49:23] <voidiss> I’m hoping so hard that this is the case. lol
[2016-02-14 01:51:01] <Emmy B> x
[2016-02-14 01:51:35] <Emmy B> Hey! Happy Valentines, love is all around 🙂
[2016-02-14 01:52:57] <Emmy B> permeates the ethers if nowhere else hehehe
[2016-02-14 02:19:15] <WISE Up Action> MGTs #internetFriendsDay went well by the look of it. Haha
[2016-02-14 10:27:25] <M> So any ideas why WLF would start with a fresh account? @wikileakz_forum At least with the ‘z’ they won’t trick people into thinking they’re legit.
[2016-02-14 10:34:07] <WISE Up Action> Do you think it reads like a different author?
[2016-02-14 10:35:53] <M> I don’t know. There’s a few things that are off to me. One, it’s retweeted some supportive things. And two, the followers/following don’t have any of the usuals.
[2016-02-14 10:36:23] <WISE Up Action> Yes agree. It’s all a bit random.
[2016-02-14 10:37:13] <WISE Up Action> And not the usual attack of MGT
[2016-02-14 10:37:48] <Cabledrum> FWLF announced to concentrate on FB but they didn’t post anything on FB today. Also, there are only 2 forum posts today (average is approx. 40). Something serious is going on there
[2016-02-14 10:38:03] <voidiss> The fact that he retweeted also some supportive things is similar to what he does in the FB pages. There are some positive, or at least neutral things there too. Maybe he wants to re-start with a less aggressive line due to the legal case?
[2016-02-14 10:45:31] <Emmy B> To my mind is certainly his present or anticipated legal troubles. Interestingly he did not blame his momentary departure to ‘death threats’ as in Oct 2012 (it only lasted a few days and then he was back) or to claims of organised attacks by WL or WLsup as he told the Steinitz woman in her two Stern articles. He spins it as a voluntary closure but he will be back. Anyway he has several socks going…so he is around and will continue spam the WL threads.
[2016-02-14 10:46:34] <Emmy B> I hope WL FB page block all his pages so he doesn’t spam their threads, easily done.
[2016-02-14 10:48:49] <Emmy B> If they do block his pages I wonder if he can still ‘Like’ the WL FB page which is displayed in his ‘Likes’ page section. It would be good if he can’t.
[2016-02-14 12:09:03] <Cabledrum> I’ve just rechecked the real IP address of the FWLF server (hidden behind Cloudflare). The real IP still is 188.165.249.110, hosted by OVH in France, owned by MGT’s wife [redacted].
[2016-02-14 12:16:29] <Emmy B> Thank you Cabbledrummer! 🙂
[2016-02-14 12:17:18] <Emmy B> Pls read about Peter Tatchell being non platformed: http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/13/peter-tatchell-snubbed-students-free-speech-veteran-gay-rights-activist?CMP=share_btn_tw
[2016-02-14 12:17:58] <Emmy B> free speech?
[2016-02-14 12:21:11] <M> Yes I saw that. It’s completely bonkers.
[2016-02-14 12:28:14] <Emmy B> Yes
[2016-02-14 14:10:34] <WISE Up Action> To be accurate, he hasn’t been no-platformed by the union, just the other speaker (who also happens to be the NUS LGBT officer) won’t share a platform with him. -> ‘The NUS told the Observer that Tatchell had not been “no-platformed” by the union as a whole, and that it was up to Cowling to make her own choices with regard to the event.’

[2016-02-14 23:38:12] <voidiss> All this debate around Kissinger-Clinton makes me remember that a teacher of the NHSMUN course told us that he was ‘a model for us’.
[2016-02-14 23:38:18] <voidiss> Great, isn’t it?
[2016-02-15 00:46:59] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/GuyOpperman/status/699142593087565824 This statement is hilariously bad.

[2016-02-15 02:46:33] <Emmy B> Wow! and thank you! what good news xxx

[2016-02-15 09:24:42] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/CNBCTV18News/status/699252362276270081
[2016-02-15 09:57:21] <LibertarianLibrarian> Wonder if it will be more political spin AKA the UK or if Sweden is feeling the pressure & is preparing to start getting out of its mess. Any bets?
[2016-02-15 10:30:34] <WISE Up Action> Is that an Indian business channel? Strange fit.
[2016-02-15 10:33:18] <Emmy B> Personally I expect more or less same as Cameron
[2016-02-15 10:34:56] <voidiss> Yes, agree. I’m too much of a pessimist for bets. I won’t believe until I see.
[2016-02-15 11:27:54] <WISE Up Action> Significant if Sweden publicly diss UN though.
[2016-02-15 11:28:57] <M> It further politicizes the case either way, which is not beneficial for Sweden.
[2016-02-15 11:52:34] <WISE Up Action> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/rituparnabhuyan/status/698749017962905600
[2016-02-15 12:35:12] <LibertarianLibrarian> Not surprising. And even though they’ve violated the Swedish legal system rules multiple times in the case already.
[2016-02-15 12:43:06] <Emmy B> Correct!
[2016-02-15 13:22:37] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/cambridgeunion/status/699329475897643008 Is he referring to the Swedish allegation as “genuine charges” here?
[2016-02-15 13:23:44] <WISE Up Action> See @AnonCopWatch
[2016-02-15 13:27:49] <M> That didn’t clarify too much. It is difficult without context, but to me it reads as if its referring to Sweden e.g. “US didn’t make up Swedish allegations to get JA, they are legit”.
[2016-02-15 13:28:21] <M> I can’t say I’m really buying this “our very best source ever” claim from AnonCopWatch re “terrorism”.
[2016-02-15 13:33:12] <WISE Up Action> The two (if there really were two?) tweets have a different emphasis
[2016-02-15 13:38:32] <M> But it seems they both can be read as either referring to Sweden or US (seeing as many Brits incorrectly use “charges”). I don’t know why there would be any purpose to changing the tweet except for accuracy/clarity — Cambridge Union posts videos of all the speeches eventually.
[2016-02-15 13:39:56] <M> To me, it seems far more likely that Grant is incorrectly referring to Swedish allegation as charges, as opposed to dropping a big bomb re the US case. But I’m interested in other analyses. It’s likely we won’t know for certain until the video is available, though.
[2016-02-15 13:42:03] <WISE Up Action> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/699327599382810625 Did you see this, M?
[2016-02-15 13:43:47] <M> Yes. That’s why I’m trying to pick apart the tweet. But again, it lacks context, as WL also pointed out.
[2016-02-15 13:53:14] <WISE Up Action> Whatever it means now (and as you say we won’t really know w/o a vid), at some point, they may need to start subtly re-introducing the concept that any charges in the US should be seen as valid
[2016-02-15 13:55:42] <WISE Up Action> evil conniving bastards
[2016-02-15 14:17:44] <LibertarianLibrarian> We all knew that was were it was going anyway, the Swedish stuff was always a smokescreen/smear campaign.
[2016-02-15 15:41:57] <WikiLeaks> The ‘corrected’ CambridgeUnion tweet is more ambiguous.
[2016-02-15 15:42:18] <WikiLeaks> It is hard to imagine the UK will pivot until the Swedish cas edrops.
[2016-02-15 15:42:51] <WikiLeaks> But it’s possible for people to get ahead of the timetable by mistake which is what seemed to be happening here.
[2016-02-15 15:58:16] <M> Hm. Will be interesting to hear it in context. Hopefully CU gets the video up soon.
[2016-02-15 22:47:59] <WISE Up Action> The Eva Joly piece in better English than the online translate until someone does it properly. Not guaranteed accurate. http://wiseupaction.info/assange-a-matter-of-right/

[2016-02-16 08:36:10] <M> Hm.
[2016-02-16 08:45:32] <voidiss> It’s weird. But this is a claim any news/anon account could make to gain attention, there’s no basis for trust. And if the Guardian’s leak of the password was implied, also Guardian journalists could be accused of terrorism.
[2016-02-16 08:52:39] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/AnonCopWatch/status/699330488998215682 Yes. This part threw me off too. I’m not sure why they would avoid naming direct deaths in Manning trial; it would actually further their case against JA to do so, imo.
[2016-02-16 09:21:38] <voidiss> IF this is the case, maybe they wanted to keep that particular charge and put it all on JA to worsen the case.
[2016-02-16 09:21:50] <voidiss> With Manning it was ‘easier’ because she’s American. But you’re right, it’s still weird.
[2016-02-16 09:21:57] <voidiss> Anyway, if they really wanted to use direct terrorism charges for that, it’d be the worst outrage in history.
[2016-02-16 12:18:13] <WikiLeaks> CFAA(1)(a) is a terrorism offence.
[2016-02-16 12:45:32] <voidiss> I’ve read that they allege there’s another one…
[2016-02-16 12:55:00] <M> I think the point WL was making is that they already are going after them with a direct terrorism charge.

[2016-02-17 03:29:51] <WikiLeaks> To be fair, it isn’t necessary to know the ins and outs of the domesticv law.
[2016-02-17 03:31:08] <WikiLeaks> It’s not acceptable for someone to be deprived of their freedom of movement for five years without a trial or any release date or mechanism.
[2016-02-17 03:31:38] <WikiLeaks> You don’t have to know anything about the domestic law to see that is a violation of the ICCPR and UDHR.
[2016-02-17 03:34:25] <M> But you do have to be an asshole to pretend it isn’t.

[2016-02-17 03:42:40] <voidiss> You’re right.
[2016-02-17 03:42:43] <voidiss> I was meaning if he wants to explain the case in details. But yes, you just need basic humanity and respect for HR to understand that.

[2016-02-17 03:47:52] <WISE Up Action> All true, but he himself was using the ‘I’m not an expert on Swe law’ approach to deflect Qs from Bella yesterday. I love the way they pick and choose but carry on anyway.

[2016-02-17 14:08:41] <WISE Up Action> The Canary have just pub’d a piece on Syria drawing on Syria Files – they tell people to donate to WikiLeaks at the end of it, and promote The WikiLeaks Files (except they haven’t changed the pic fr KM’s austerity book and also the link to buy the book goes to the Amazon page for that Austerity book). The article ends with: ‘The importance of whistleblowers and organisations such as Wikileaks in exposing such truths cannot be understated.
Get involved!
– Support or donate to Wikileaks’

[2016-02-17 14:48:33] <Emmy B> He is also making a complete fool of himself attacking ppl who complain about his posts/comments.
[2016-02-17 14:54:10] <Emmy B> Something very curious at the fake forum, new member ‘Frodo’ spams all over the place, posts not moved to the graveyard, deleted. I wonder what game MGT plays.
[2016-02-17 16:48:51] <WikiLeaks> WL enemies end badly.
[2016-02-17 16:50:55] <WikiLeaks> Sometimes it is because we cause it to happen, othertimes it seems like fate.
[2016-02-17 16:52:32] <M> Poetic justice.
[2016-02-17 16:52:36] <WikiLeaks> Our view on the latter is that most of our opponents are opportunists. That’s why they became opponents. But opportunists are they way because they cannot sustain long term plans.
[2016-02-17 16:54:17] <WikiLeaks> Often they cannot even sustain long term positive relationsips. That’s why they turn to negative relationships as a ‘business’ model.
[2016-02-17 16:56:30] <WikiLeaks> Some, like Bill Keller, only have power as a servent; when they fall from grace, they are back to nothing.
[2016-02-17 19:10:14] <M> Cambridge Union put up a “highlights” video, and although it has a segment on Assange, but it does not cover the quote in question. (at 4:00) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4OBWNaWNlE
[2016-02-17 19:12:21] <M> Interesting though, Sir Mark Lyall Grant notes one of the main 4 threats to British security is the erosion of international law (at 2:50), specifically the UN and how certain countries want to flout their order (oh, the irony).
[2016-02-17 19:14:56] <M> Cringing at him calling UK the “innocent party” in the Assange case.
[2016-02-17 19:15:53] <WISE Up Action> Aha. What a rip-off. Along with the *altered* tweet makes it seem a bit sus.
[2016-02-17 19:17:48] <M> Still not getting that vibe, but I guess we’ll just have to keep waiting!
[2016-02-17 19:29:15] <WISE Up Action> Having just listened to it, I’m not surprised they only put ‘highlights’ up! Tedious old fart.

[2016-02-19 00:31:49] <Emmy B> Excellent!
[2016-02-19 03:20:02] <Emmy B> About WL opponents being opportunists is a very interesting perspective which puts the context of a great number of rewards, all kinds, being bestowed upon them.
[2016-02-19 03:20:39] <Emmy B> It is an excellent perspective to review opponents.
[2016-02-19 03:25:15] <Emmy B> Re MGT my perspective is screwed by my experience and damaged as I have become by it, a rational review is hampered by general confusion. I try in my blogposts to offer some perspective or at least some facts and explore some answers, primarily to inform others to the fraud of his operation that I see myself (and WL) as a victim of.
[2016-02-19 03:39:46] <Emmy B> Still, in btw his psychopathy, bullying, ability to deceive, influence and control a rational motive like reward of money, immunity from other crimes etc would be far more palatable, rather than pure malice as motivator for what he has spewed over the years on WLsup/WL. Opportunists must not been given the opportunity in the first place. That is my greatest lesson.

[2016-02-19 13:08:36] <WISE Up Action> “Meanwhile, the European Parliament intends to intervene in the case. Thirty-eight social democratic MEPs, United Left, Greens and Liberals have sent a joint letter to the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, to express “great concern” about the violation of Julian Assange rights by both countries Union members. MEPs regret the silence of the European institutions in this matter, and urge the Commission to take “immediate and effective measures” for the countries concerned fold the decisions of the UN working group.”

[2016-02-20 10:58:06] <WISE Up Action> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/WISEUpAction/status/701112272861716480 Our March issue of New Internationalist came today. The magazine majors on a particular topic each month and tries to deal more in depth than most w different articles on same subject. The ‘Big Story’ this month is Saudi Arabia – called ‘Blood Brothers’, it has Cameron & Abdullah engaged in a blood soaked handshake on cover. The i/vw w JA is on the insight into Saudi regime we can get from SaudiCables, under 7 headings. 1.A Paranoid Ruling Elite 2.Moves to Destabilise Syria Prior to Uprising 3.Using Religion 4.Terrified of Iran and Shi’a Influence 5. How to Bribe Foreign Media 6.The Saudi-Israel Nexus and the West 7.Dodgy Deals for US Votes. Good old New Int also says: ‘JA has been detained in Britain for 5 yrs, unable to leave his place of refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy without risk of being arrested and extradited to the US which wants to try him for espionage…’
[2016-02-20 22:55:11] <Cabledrum> There are ZERO new admin posts on FWLF since 5 days. (Average is approx. 40 posts per day.) As a solution, they have now removed the usage statistics. Really strange…
[2016-02-20 23:01:51] <Emmy B> yes and member ‘Frodo’ posts are spam, but have not been removed.
[2016-02-20 23:02:31] <Emmy B> MGT wants to give the appearance that the site has been abandoned.
[2016-02-20 23:04:36] <Emmy B> it is all contrived, has written to court apparently about the deletion of the twitter account, trying to evade justice.
[2016-02-20 23:05:18] <M> What’s the point of abandoning Twitter/Forum if the Facebook page (titled after the forum website) is still active?
[2016-02-20 23:05:18] <Emmy B> what usage statistics?
[2016-02-20 23:05:50] <Emmy B> FB page has not been used in court case
[2016-02-20 23:06:08] <M> I see.
[2016-02-20 23:06:41] <Emmy B> Twitter is where most of the defamation took place linking to the forum posts
[2016-02-20 23:08:25] <Emmy B> the forum posts he has hidden in a ‘holding’ board not appearing public at the moment but in twitter there were still defamatory tweets (I think he made so many he could not find them all to delete them)
[2016-02-20 23:09:34] <Emmy B> he claims to have nothing to do with forum but he asked the admin to remove them which the admin did.
[2016-02-20 23:10:46] <Emmy B> he now claims to only host the forum and been paid by Jerry Barney to do so but has no access to it. It is all lies.
[2016-02-20 23:12:55] <Emmy B> his ability to lie is amazing but the question is whether the judges will find the evidence against him conclusive and we will know hopefully on the 10th of March.
[2016-02-20 23:16:55] <Cabledrum> I doubt that it has anything to do with the court case. The court hearing (PC vs. MGT) took place 4 weeks ago. Whatever happens now, can not influence the ruling anymore.
[2016-02-20 23:17:37] <Emmy B> Please be discreet with this information, if successful Chris intends to make the evidence public but she has some way to go with this issue. She has pursued this to great personal cost and it is primarily a private matter although of course as we can see before our eyes it restricts MGT’s activities.
[2016-02-20 23:18:02] <Emmy B> He continues to submit evidence to court.
[2016-02-20 23:18:41] <Emmy B> whether this has an effect or not it is anyone’s quess
[2016-02-20 23:20:11] <Emmy B> I have not been asked to attend as witness, which possibly means that there will be ruling on the 10th rather than a call for further witness based evidence. But one can never know.
[2016-02-20 23:21:06] <Emmy B> keeping fingers crossed
[2016-02-20 23:23:15] <Emmy B> My personal opinion is that even when court finds against him, unless behind bars, he will not stop his pursue of WL WLsup.
[2016-02-20 23:27:44] <Emmy B> Neither do I think he stays idle currently, he is active in places outside the ones we have identified.

[2016-02-22 16:16:29] <M> He doesn’t seem to have tweeted anything else about it. Is there any sort of notification clause in UK FOI law?
[2016-02-22 16:17:52] <WikiLeaks> No.
[2016-02-22 16:24:13] <M> So I’m guessing government contact, then.
[2016-02-22 16:27:07] <WISE Up Action> what Em’s meaning above…very interesting
[2016-02-22 16:28:29] <WikiLeaks> We have FOI’s of a UK journalist giving GCHQ info on Assange.
[2016-02-22 16:28:55] <M> I guess another possibility is that one of the other journalists has the government contact, and then informed DAG.

Who knows? in the meanwhile, we plan to leaflet again outside the Melodi Festivalen party in London this Saturday, raising awareness among the Swedes in London about the plight of JA. Let’s hope this time (without the somewhat intimidating presence of a camera and journalist from DW) we get to have some interesting conversations with the young Swedes 🙂

[2016-02-23 08:53:09] <Emmy B> Hi everyone, I just added Hazel @Hazelpress2 the backup account re-joining us, as first account has problems. Their new site address is: http://hazelpress.org.uk/
[2016-02-23 08:53:42] <Emmy B> Nice to have you back Hazel! 🙂
[2016-02-23 11:19:18] <M> I think we need to curate a list of all the influential figures/bodies that have come out in support of the UNWGAD/called for UK/Swe to accept.
[2016-02-23 13:20:40] <Emmy B> I would be interested in printing a new flyer with the UN decision and such quotes
[2016-02-23 13:36:52] <Emmy B> I attempted to download torrent, ended up with ‘trovi dot com’ on my Safari and Chrome browser homepage, it keeps defaulting, can’t get rid of it. In Chrome it kept taking me to all kinds of ad and porn pages. Make sure you know what you are doing if you attempt to download and don’t do what I did: “this is a button with DOWNLOAD written on it, so I press it” Aghrrr!
[2016-02-23 13:50:42] <Emmy B> interesting: Tor browser the only one not affected
[2016-02-23 13:53:30] <M> Sorry to hear that. Run a malware scanner, like malwarebytes.
[2016-02-23 13:54:33] <Emmy B> thank you! will do
[2016-02-23 14:12:25] <Bean> ref flyer – good thinking – here when you need me of course 🙂
[2016-02-23 14:15:50] <Emmy B> Thank you M it worked! 🙂 thank you Magic Bean we shall get to it tomorrow! xx
[2016-02-23 17:21:21] <WISE Up Action> @M, Em, Bean – re curating list etc – many of the responses to UNGWAD are in the post on our site – last section – RESOURCES, though I’m behind and have a list of more recent links to add still. Intention was always to keep it updated as a resource. Here http://wiseupaction.info/2016/02/07/sweet-victory-assange-vindication-by-united-nations-summary-resources/
[2016-02-23 21:52:02] <WISE Up Action> I’ve updated the list in RESOURCES section at the very end of this post here again now http://wiseupaction.info/2016/02/07/sweet-victory-assange-vindication-by-united-nations-summary-resources/
[2016-02-23 22:21:24] <Emmy B> You are Amazing! <3 Thank you so much for this, I will take a look for quotes for the flyer later on today xxxx
[2016-02-24 11:12:07] <Emmy B> Guys and Girls I have blocked Shaf Patel. The police here has found evidence linking him to the harassment of Chris. His habit of recording telephone conversations and live conversations if I may add is, already, rather odd to say the least but this new evidence makes me adopt a ‘best be safe than sorry approach’. If more info becomes available I will let you know.
[2016-02-24 12:03:33] <WISE Up Action> Thanks for heads up, Em.

[2016-02-25 10:57:16] <M> Google’s coming out with its own Cloudfare. http://boingboing.net/2016/02/25/449890.html
[2016-02-25 11:00:55] <WikiLeaks> That’s good. It means they’re not buying cloudflare. Or does it?
[2016-02-25 11:25:17] <M> Good question! They did partner in 2015.
[2016-02-25 16:02:22] <voidiss> I’m sorry, I don’t know why, Google Translate doesn’t work properly with this article, but still, in the final part it says that an “influential source at the White House” told La Stampa that the type of data gathering cercerning the espionage on Berlusconi is now already limited by the USA Freedom Act and, well, I find this particularly amazing not just because that law is a blatant facade, but because it explicitly involves American citizens only and I don’t think Berlusconi is American, hm. Well, their justifications are so pathetic. http://www.lastampa.it/2016/02/24/esteri/obama-estende-tutela-privacy-a-stranieri-alleati-yHA1pnDaXorV0kF3tEl1SJ/pagina.html
[2016-02-25 18:46:28] <LibertarianLibrarian> Sorry to hear that something is off with Shaf. Pls do keep us informed, Emmy.
[2016-02-25 18:48:15] <LibertarianLibrarian> Greta – like over 90% of Americans, I know my government is invariably up to no good. My Dad & I were bemoaning the Presidential race situation today, which is simply disgusting.
[2016-02-25 18:50:45] <LibertarianLibrarian> Sorry I’ve been absent a lot. I think ‘tenure track’ is simply an academic excuse for severely overworking young/new faculty. But I did just sign away copyright (ridiculous) on a book chapter that should be published this spring. Publish or perish. *sigh*
[2016-02-25 18:52:21] <LibertarianLibrarian> On the good side – it looks like I may indeed be taking a trip to Madagascar in August to teach health information skills to doctors there. Pending WHO & MLA funding. That would be a trip of a lifetime!
[2016-02-25 21:52:08] <Emmy B> Wow Jenny <3 well done!
[2016-02-26 05:59:36] <WikiLeaks> Madagascar is neat.

[2016-02-26 06:00:48] <WikiLeaks> It starts Monday and goes for three weeks but with most of the big action in the first week (e.g Lavrov talks on Tuesday).

[2016-02-26 06:01:56] <WikiLeaks> We hear UK is making a concerted push over UNWGAD.
[2016-02-26 06:03:47] <Emmy B> The matter is placed in the international political and diplomatic arena where it belongs.
[2016-02-26 06:04:38] <Emmy B> JA’s speech at the UN ‘Can UN protect Whistleblowers in the West’ is good to put out there. I will find it

[2016-02-27 06:41:54] <Emmy B> Remarkable article by retired colonel on Greek on alert national defence blog calling for dismantling Nato bases, identifying ‘such military structures as the reason for the rivers of refugees, their own drama as well as the undermining of Greek sovereignty.
[2016-02-27 06:41:59] <Emmy B> http://www.onalert.gr/stories/ta-potamia-ton-prosfygwn-den-prohlthan-apo-parthenogenesi/48225
[2016-02-27 06:46:16] <Emmy B> The communist party and other leftwing parties have often blasted militarism but to see a retired colonel expressing such pragmatic observations without the leftwing rhetoric and being hosted in a blog that has a section for paid Nato promotion articles is a sign that such ideas become mainstream not via ideological rhetoric or indoctrination but by the application of common sense.
[2016-02-27 06:47:39] <Emmy B> In the meanwhile, Nato has started its ‘refugee operation’ in the Aegean yesterday.

[2016-03-01 02:56:15] <Emmy B> The publisher of ancient right wing paper ‘Acropolis’ in Greece is facing blackmailing charges. Extortion and political influence the name of the day as per WL Cablegate releases in 2011/2 among Greek Media. At the same time, ‘scandal’ of Tsipras discussions with publisher of ‘Mega’ Media group leaked. In parliament new media laws force TV stations to start paying licence fees to the state (for the first time). WL’s US cable release keep popping up in local articles.
[2016-03-01 07:40:59] <Emmy B> Not a good article on DN.se it claims all sorts including referring to rulings by UK High Court and Supreme Court http://www.dn.se/debatt/repliker/fn-panelens-beslut-om-assange-ar-felaktiga/

[2016-03-01 09:10:48] <WikiLeaks> He’s a taxi-driver with a brain tumor who is an anti-Assange troll. He hangs out on Flashback as “who is joe…”
[2016-03-01 09:10:53] <M> Gawd. That’s desperate.
[2016-03-01 09:11:59] <M> If he’s the only one they could find for the anti-JA piece, that’s a good sign.
[2016-03-01 09:12:36] <WikiLeaks> Yes.
[2016-03-01 09:13:08] <WikiLeaks> He has no weight and lies a lot in the article.
[2016-03-01 09:13:49] <WikiLeaks> e.g claming that Sweden was not sent our arguments. Not only did they receive them, we published them.
[2016-03-01 09:15:11] <WikiLeaks> Could be worth tweeting some of his insanity at dn / dn editors, e.g his bent penis episode with braingarbage
[2016-03-01 09:27:06] <Emmy B> The DN writer seems to pass the buck to UK side (High Court / Supreme Court) which indicates, not much holds up on the Swedish side of things (Prosecution/Police etc). It will all come out in the wash in the end, just hang on in there WL <3 🙂
[2016-03-01 09:28:32] <Emmy B> The best thing will be when Sweden/UK will start blaming each other 🙂 and compete with each other to the finishing line over how to save face.

[2016-03-01 09:39:39] <Bean> Just saw this comment on the WL FB page: ‘I love you guys whistleblowers I would give my blood f u but I’m confused there are many wikileaks sites they attacking Julian Assange can you clear that up f me by any chance?!’
[2016-03-01 09:40:19] <Bean> can someone suggest a good link to give a quick explanation of this? – if so, I’ll post it as a reply for them
[2016-03-01 09:47:29] <WikiLeaks> He just fabricates a lot of his claims from whole cloth

[2016-03-01 10:31:13] <Emmy B> Read here some of his tactics in FB at the time: http://archive.is/PUXDe#selection-4811.0-4811.94
[2016-03-01 10:32:12] <Emmy B> He says at some point: “I am afraid I dont know who deleted it. You would have to ask the discussion forum admin that.” Well, we now know he was ‘a forum Admin’ at the time.
[2016-03-01 10:36:23] <Emmy B> The fwlf FB page shows unusual comment activity. It never used to. It could very well be the case some of the commentators are himself, even if they are ‘protesting against his defamation’. He used to do the same at the forum, get a sockie on, go trolling, Voda, an admin caught him out doing it by checking his IP, she confronted him, he flipped, eventually banned her.

[2016-03-02 02:56:29] <WikiLeaks> Perhaps Hillary will have a stroke.
[2016-03-02 03:46:57] <Emmy B> Greek military analysts openly now discuss that Nato’s role in the Aegean is not to counteract people smuggling by Turkish profiteers or stop the refugees & migrants from seeking EU residence or saving ppl from drowning but to prepare for Nato Intervention in Syria and control of Russia naval passage through Dardanelles.
[2016-03-02 05:05:23] <Emmy B> 🙂
[2016-03-02 06:23:05] <WISE Up Action> That’s very interesting about FOIs, H. Would be so good to tie the pompous git into it.
[2016-03-02 07:34:36] <LibertarianLibrarian> LOL Hazel! 😭
[2016-03-02 07:38:02] <LibertarianLibrarian> Maybe Hillary will have a heart-attack. I’m more worried about her than Trump. If he gets elected, they’ll lock him in the White House and only let him out when highly drugged and programmed. The bureaucracy will run itself. And Congress will block him. Though it might just collapse the Republican Party or create a revolt within it. We need to dump the two-party electoral college system anyway.
[2016-03-02 07:39:02] <LibertarianLibrarian> Hillary is more dangerous because she can manipulate the system and bureaucracy and she’s one of them, so they’ll let her.
[2016-03-02 07:42:07] <LibertarianLibrarian> But I’m not counting Sanders out yet. And I think some seriously rallying behind Cruz is going to happen, even to the point of something major being done on the convention floor. I believe the delegates have some leeway to shift allegiance though my memory of electoral law isn’t good. In my party, the delegates can toss out every candidate and put in anyone they choose. But that’s Libertarians for you.
[2016-03-02 07:42:47] <LibertarianLibrarian> I’m just so embarrassed people are voting for Trump and Hillary. It’s so shaming.
[2016-03-02 07:45:51] <WikiLeaks> It’s worse than shaming. It’s happening.
[2016-03-02 08:13:52] <M> If Trump gets elected, the country will be run by all the other high-up figures, e.g. the DoD.
[2016-03-02 08:30:51] <WikiLeaks> If HC gets up, Sydney Blumenthal, Anne Mareir Slaughter, Nuland, Jared Cohen, Alec Ross, Google et al will be running the country.
[2016-03-02 08:31:27] <WikiLeaks> And also Podesta; who beleives in aliens.
[2016-03-02 08:31:48] <M> Choose your new overlords wisely, America!
[2016-03-02 08:35:34] <WikiLeaks> The chief of staff character in House of Cards appears to be based on Podesta.
[2016-03-02 08:42:03] <M> Couldn’t do House of Cards. No likable characters – just like real politics.
[2016-03-02 08:44:40] <WikiLeaks> Haha.
[2016-03-02 09:32:25] <voidiss> I agree with you. And moreover, I’m also quite scared that people don’t get this difference between Hillary and Trump;
[2016-03-02 09:32:59] <voidiss> people consider Trump more dangerous than Hillary, they think he’s the problem and someone I know even thinks that if he was elected,
[2016-03-02 09:33:07] <voidiss> people would ‘rebel’ against this and remove it from the White House somehow and this is really absurd.
[2016-03-02 09:33:16] <voidiss> On the other hand, even if they don’t like Hillary a lot, they still think she wouldn’t do as many damages as Trump.
[2016-03-02 09:33:19] <voidiss> They don’t get Hillary’s sneakiness.
[2016-03-02 10:23:55] <Emmy B> Hmm Things are as they are, the most powerful leader of the world, with impunity, finds imitators who will proudly ‘come out’. Cultural/political imperialism goes deeper into a society ie, with Hilary US will be instigating civil wars, war and chaos, with Trump at the head of the merry-go-round, they will be springing up by themselves and he will be simply clapping – mirroring effect?

[2016-03-02 14:15:02] <LibertarianLibrarian> M’s right, an elected Trump is a figurehead and the govt will basically run itself in status quo, or nothing will get done b/c Congress will stalemate things. The VP may become unusually powerful, depending on who grabs it. It’s just, as WL said, worse than shaming. Maybe the internal confusion will keep my country out of more war-expansion. Doubt it. 🙁
[2016-03-02 14:19:24] <WISE Up Action> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/BellaMagnani/status/703508209940733952 From Bella recently:
[2016-03-02 14:19:46] <LibertarianLibrarian> But yes, Hillary is far more dangerous. Trump’s just an idiot and crazy. We’ve had incompetent Presidents before and survived. Hillary is outright malignant. She’s my biggest fear. She’s manipulative, megalomaniac, power- and money- hungry and wouldn’t know a conscience if it bit her on the ass.
[2016-03-02 14:20:26] <LibertarianLibrarian> Wow, these trolls are good at playing identity games.
[2016-03-02 14:27:34] <WISE Up Action> H: Some similar language to the old Preston account…?

[2016-03-03 08:18:52] <M> Reuters article didn’t mention this, but apparently Schmidt is saying the Pentagon advisory board “isn’t a company initiative, but rather a personal move”. Because that’s what we all strive for in our personal life, right? http://gizmodo.com/former-google-ceo-is-helping-the-pentagon-just-as-a-pe-1762511752

[2016-03-03 13:47:17] <LibertarianLibrarian> Well, I thought the US wouldn’t survive the first Clinton Presidency at that time. We’ll survive, it just won’t be pretty with either Hillary or Trump. But I’m still very worried about Hillary getting us into worse situations in the Middle East (it can, sadly, always get worse) and into wars with China and Russia, at the very least ‘cold wars’ but all her military corporate friends want to make money and that means boots on the ground in places they shouldn’t be. Trump’s more likely to go the isolationist route which is bad too but less bad and I still think a Trump Presidency would be a deadlock with Congress. 4 years of nothing. But I still think the GOP will get Cruz into the nomination by hook or crook or any means necessary.
[2016-03-03 13:50:57] <LibertarianLibrarian> So does that personal move mean Schmidt has left Google? Somehow I suspect he’s still promoting their interests which have become part & parcel of Hillary’s. Power and control.
[2016-03-03 13:51:47] <LibertarianLibrarian> LOL M – that’s the best thing about trolls like Foust. Their own idiocy speaks for itself.
[2016-03-03 13:54:20] <M> No, he has not left Google (or “Alphabet”). He’s just attempting to separate his Pentagon endeavors from his business one, which is bullshit.
[2016-03-03 13:54:23] <LibertarianLibrarian> Ah, yup, staying with Google.

[2016-03-05 06:03:32] <LibertarianLibrarian> Wow, Rudling’s post is crazy. Where does he get the bizarre idea Sweden didn’t know Assange’s arguments and respond, when everyone knows they did. They even knew the decision far in advance of him. Just…WTF?
[2016-03-05 06:05:08] <Emmy B> Exactly
[2016-03-05 06:34:54] <WikiLeaks> Btw Rudling and Sandra haand others ve been engaging in a private email influence campaign.
[2016-03-05 06:35:05] <WikiLeaks> There are highly effective.
[2016-03-05 06:36:35] <WikiLeaks> If it’s a choice between spending time debating with nobodies on twitter e.g the way Bella wastes her time, and writing emails to people in positions of influence we know it is much more effective to write emails/letters.
[2016-03-05 06:51:08] <Emmy B> Bella has educated a great number supporters on the details of the case just by following through her discussions. She is breaking down a complicated case in easily understood bits. Each one will choose how to spend their time according to ability and disposition. I think debating with trolls is certainly to be avoided. The letter writing is certainly an area we have not explored fully and it is worth doing more in that direction certainly.

[2016-03-05 07:46:52] <Emmy B> (btw it was amazing to attend, how the police agents had relationship for years with activists for years sometimes having children with them, then disappearing, heartbreaking, 2 women involved spoke at the meeting)

[2016-03-06 08:50:07] <WISE Up Action> Sweden. Ha.
[2016-03-06 08:57:13] <M> It’s based on a 2013 WIN/Gallup poll. There’s a summary here, but I’m not sure where the more detailed information comes from, or if it exists. http://www.wingia.com/web/files/services/33/file/33.pdf

[2016-03-06 13:27:09] <M> “Google is debuting a new tool for celebrities and businesses to share information directly to Google’s search results.” http://fortune.com/2016/03/05/google-posts/
[2016-03-06 13:51:11] <Emmy B> Quote: “What’s unclear yet is how Google will monetize these posts, and whether they will become an advertising product.”
[2016-03-06 13:52:23] <Emmy B> or establish Google further as an information power broker and propagandist platform with invisible strings attached?
[2016-03-06 14:06:51] <Emmy B> Interesting parallel, Fresh from the press, in recent years Siemens bribes to Greek politicians and political parties have been called for what they have been. This week there is a concentrated effort to present them as legal donations!!! In the Information market Google is trading, ‘donating’ space to celebrities and political personalities could be a disguised bribe. In the monopolistic position Google has carved for itself such ‘bribes’ serve only as barriers of entry to other players as the Monopoly from an economic power moves to couple with established political power. Whilst states have in the past tried and tested methods of breaking up monopolies/oligopolies, in the Information era, in the ether world, the proposition package offered to the shakers and movers of state (ie free PR access) and society is too attractive for any state institution or group to seek to legislate against it, at least in this current ‘wildwest’ market stage. Continental Europe has made some efforts against Google, whether these will continue now that G is intertwining so publicly with US state power (eg. Pentagon) is to be seen.
[2016-03-06 20:42:34] <WikiLeaks> Almost no point emailing Mps unless they are a constitute, but for people who don’t receive a constant deluge of email this can be powerful. e.g like people in key positions of amnesty, liberty, reprive, in the fco, homeoffice, business people, un, unhcr etc.
[2016-03-06 20:43:49] <WikiLeaks> and mps/meps in their function of being on related parliamentry committees

[2016-03-06 21:16:14] <Emmy B> Ok thanks for this, such people are more difficult to identify unless one has years of experience in HR work. Which I don’t, still, at my level, parliament offers opportunities.
[2016-03-06 21:16:27] <WISE Up Action> OK. I’ll do Amnesty and Liberty and give it some thought generally re others x

[2016-03-07 18:30:20] <voidiss> Okay, we have finally finished the NHSMUN simulation and adopted a ‘resolution’ on the topic. And it is horrible.
[2016-03-07 18:30:51] <voidiss> A colossal farce, just like too often it happens in reality. Sure, it states that SPECPOL committee wants a two-States solutions for
[2016-03-07 18:31:10] <voidiss> the Israeli-Palestinian problem, but I only mention that in it there is a proposal to “”aid”” Palestinian refugees by creating
[2016-03-07 18:31:45] <voidiss> a tracking system and a database that will keep data for 20 years and also it includes an amendment that urges to keep
[2016-03-07 18:32:13] <voidiss> the Israeli-West Bank barrier to protect Israel’s national security (the beloved natsec) and encourages Israeli-controlled checkpoints
[2016-03-07 18:33:19] <voidiss> along it, purportedly to “”ease”” access for Palestinians (riiight, we all believe that); it’d use that database to allow passage.
[2016-03-07 18:33:33] <voidiss> Yes, it vaguely gives the possibility to make them monitored by some independent orgs, but we all know how it would end if it was true.
[2016-03-07 18:33:44] <voidiss> Plus, it calls for Israeli oversight of land historically owned by Palestinians now occupied by the barriers.
[2016-03-07 18:33:57] <voidiss> Oh, and I haven’t mentioned the best bit yet: a proposal to offer countries ‘carbon credits’ to offset the costs associated with
[2016-03-07 18:34:19] <voidiss> carbon emissions violations in exchange for hosting more refugees. And well, hosting more refugees would be good,
[2016-03-07 18:34:23] <voidiss> but not in this way… ever heard of climate change, guys? No, apparently no.
[2016-03-07 18:35:03] <voidiss> It was voted with a HUGE majority. And even worse, it was backed by a HUGE majority – the number of sponsors and signatories
[2016-03-07 18:35:27] <voidiss> amounted to almost the whole committee. The only other draft resolution (that was way better, more pro-Palestine and was obviously rejected)
[2016-03-07 18:35:40] <voidiss> was backed by the delegates representing Iran and a just few others.
[2016-03-07 18:35:56] <voidiss> And the worst thing is that I was obliged to back the bad one because of my country’s policy.
[2016-03-07 18:36:18] <voidiss> And despite this, I tried to change at least the worst parts but no one listened. I repeated many times my privacy/environmental
[2016-03-07 18:36:31] <voidiss> concerns but… silence. It was overwhelmingly distressing, really. I actually cried when it passed.
[2016-03-07 18:36:48] <voidiss> God, those guys are the leaders and delegates of tomorrow. Our world is fucked up.
[2016-03-07 18:37:05] <voidiss> But apart from all this, it was really interesting and NYC is a striking city!
[2016-03-07 18:37:06] <voidiss> As soon as I come back home, I email Italian Amnesty. Then I’ll leave for the LoganCIJ! 🙂
[2016-03-07 22:22:07] <Emmy B> Wonderful Greta, lots of good things despite frustrations. Enjoy LoganCIJ! 🙂
[2016-03-08 06:33:44] <LibertarianLibrarian> Wow, that is a bit shocking, Greta. Great experience, though. Glad you’ve had some time in NYC. I find it a bit overwhelming when I go in, but I’m glad to have access without living in it. Enjoy the Logan conference!

[2016-03-08 13:09:09] <Emmy B> @ W if you are writing to Amnesty UK with the news about Fredriksson check out if Nicola Duckworth, Senior Director for Research at Amnesty Intenational’s headquarters in London, is still working there, she is quoted in the local’s article, would be the right person as she would for sure have ben originally involved and may now wish to comment.
[2016-03-08 13:12:26] <Emmy B> If Fredriksson was working for SAPO at the time, many who commented at the end of the article could have been his colleagues.
[2016-03-08 13:32:18] <WikiLeaks> What kind of prisoner’s rights organization (“amnesty”) campaigns to have someone extradited into prison and against guarentees of re-extradition?
[2016-03-08 13:35:30] <Emmy B> Indeed!
[2016-03-08 13:38:20] <Emmy B> Fredriksson also pops up here: https://archive.is/G4UeW

[2016-03-08 14:01:47] <WikiLeaks> Swedes still refuse to talk about the JA/WL angle.
[2016-03-08 14:02:02] <WikiLeaks> What a vile little society.

[2016-03-08 14:46:04] <Emmy B> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/647421818081517568 This ‘haters’ expose Fredriksson potentially mastermind, why does it bring to mind this?
[2016-03-08 14:58:56] <Emmy B> I don’t know what to make of this, another researchgruppen staff https://archive.is/exfrShttp://archive.is/ZKhdU
[2016-03-08 15:09:03] <WikiLeaks> Which tweet?
[2016-03-09 08:21:05] <Emmy B> What I hinted above is the following: Fredriksson was involved in a. ‘exposing’ vulnerabilities at Disqus b. ‘exposing’ Right-wing haters via Expressen collaboration. We now know Fredriksson was a SAPO agent. Therefore his actions had ulterior motives, other than the ones he professed. What would that motive be? a. generally snoop around and collect personal info as well as dirt on ppl that SAPO could lean on for political and other influence. b. create a name for his organisation for protecting privacy (!!!??? preposterous I know) and protecting the vulnerable. c. Focusing on ‘haters’, creating a scandal, contribute in massaging public opinion on how dangerous online hate speech is when right-wingers are involved, singing from the same song sheet that calls for censoring ‘insulting online speech’ after re-defining it as ‘violence online’ pushing public opinion in a certain direction.
[2016-03-09 08:23:55] <WikiLeaks> what we need is women who slept with him to come forward and say they were raped because they did not consent to sleeping with a sapo agent
[2016-03-09 08:47:36] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/TomZdechovskyEP/status/707502470898049025
[2016-03-09 08:49:35] <Emmy B> *I know* i often thought during the public meeting I went to about the women (and the rest of the individuals) involved with the undercover agents how is it that for Example the Edward Snowden revelations of widespread surveillance or JA’s 24/7 surveillance or WL revelations about surveillance were never mentioned. To me it feels the same political issue of surveillance. The study the organisers did showed that this practice (agents sleeping with the objects of surveillance) went on continuously for a period of 30 years, ie, it proves we are not dealing with isolated cases of rogue agents but of a practice that was propagated by the state actors. One of the lawyers suggested to criminalise for agents to have sex with people they surveill. Still despite the public attention that has been created, the play, the book, the documentary, the public enquiry, why is it that such highly political issue as state surveillance has been kind of de-politicised via its personalisation. Yes, the women who exposed this practice did so in a personal capacity, yes, there might be as a result some responsibility apportioned, some compensation given but it seems to me this is an isolationist approach, a de-politicization, compartmentalised. At a time when in the UK there is the snoopers charter very much in the news, and there are campaigns via ngo’s civil society to push back, at the time when you have Jenny Jones scandalously been surveilled and lied on in FOI request for her files, time when Caroline Lucas legal action proved Wilson doctrine is a puff of air, time when JA surveilled 24/7 at enormous cost etc etc at the time when Trade Unionists expose and push back regarding blacklisting, why is it that all these matters are not unified under the same banner and find a loud political voice in Westminster. So yes, WL statement has various levels, 1. What does it take to create public opinion to react to the Fredriksson scandal? perhaps the personal drama of the women or men he was involved with sexually, even then it might be that society only sees the wrong in his conduct only under the prism of personal betrayal which they will describe as abuse. 2. What does it take for Swedish public opinion to see it is the Swedish state that is behaving in this manner, ie it is a political matter, that Fredriksson deceived, lied and manipulated because it was in his job description, he received a salary for it and he had a performance appraisal at the end of it, all paid for by the Swedish Taxpayer. 3. When does the Swedish public opinion define such behaviour as corruption, ie state surveilance, deception, manipulation is corruption, even in a ‘democracy’.

[2016-03-11 15:22:31] <LibertarianLibrarian> I’m with Emmy. It’s very tempting to be childish towards O’Hagan because that’s how he acts. So spitting on him sounds about his age.

[2016-03-13 07:17:01] <LibertarianLibrarian> OK, I can’t resist. If I get taken for $10 I can live with that, but I want to see the early release digital comic when/if it comes out. LOL

[2016-03-13 07:30:02] <voidiss> That sculpture at logancij – other than a neat piece of art itself – is also a small model for a future real-size sculpture. In Berlin (I don’t remember where) there’s already a hourglass sculpture and an artist is in the process of asking to the officials in charge of that the permission to paint it with WL logo colours, so there will be a WL ‘monument’ in Berlin centre!
[2016-03-13 07:36:05] <Emmy B> All good contributions, thanks everyone, out and about with family today so not much time, amazing murray post!!! And looking forwards to more videos/audios from Logan as they come out. Greta, great news looking forward to your comments of the events xxx
[2016-03-13 07:41:16] <Emmy B> I forwarded S Hersh commentary on Syria to militaire, new greek national defence website, they immediately published it, his views, always valuable will reach an audience, the Greek military which views with alarm Nato activity in the Aegean, Turkeys bazar style bargaining with Nato and EU and a civil administration in Greece captured by the financial strangulation and the creditors demands.
[2016-03-13 07:44:00] <Emmy B> If civil admin loses the confidence of the army Greece will go back to darkest days. Will the politicians left and right finally break through and effectively manage the crisis?
[2016-03-13 07:44:04] <WikiLeaks> Greek title over the Islands close to Turkey are not sustainable from a military perspective
[2016-03-13 07:45:18] <WikiLeaks> Turkey is going to continue to harress them until Greece gives way, which it will.
[2016-03-13 07:46:47] <WikiLeaks> Unlikely to be a formal hander over, but Greece will have to make an informal concession at some stage.
[2016-03-13 08:06:13] <Emmy B> Such a view is abhorrent. Last time US auctioned off Hellenic land to Turkey with the assistance of UK and Israel it took a military regime in Greece to act as their willing pawn.
[2016-03-13 08:08:38] <Emmy B> The military regime was enabled because of internal political instability festered for decades by the greek palace. This factor is absent from Greek politics since 1974.
[2016-03-13 08:13:46] <Emmy B> Turkey the aggressor has been indeed emboldened by the impunity they enjoyed 40 yrs on on Cyprus invasion and occupation. What perhaps is not understood in the West is that the ambitions are not just half the Aegean. For why should Turkey establish a naval vase in Albania?
[2016-03-13 08:14:23] <Emmy B> I leave the conversation here 🙂
[2016-03-13 08:21:02] <Emmy B> But here is what happened in the region not that long ago http://www.britannica.com/topic/Balkan-Wars
[2016-03-13 11:07:01] <voidiss> This kind of slow, silent expansionism that we see in the Aegan makes me think that ‘neutral zones’ have no chance of survival in this world, because the most powerful country in question would surely find a way to slowly overcome the ‘neutral’ barrier. When in NYC we were discussing about possible political solutions for the Israel-Palestine problem, someone in my committee came up and proposed to transform Jerusalem and a small area around it into ‘international zone’, therefore neutral and supervised by the UN. When he said that – even if the situation are different – this Turkey-Greece case popped up in my mind. I mean, here we see a ‘frontier zone’ between Turkey and Greece, but this frontier zone is blurred because of the presence of sea and various islands, so even if officially there’s an established sovereignty, it’s easy to create ‘grey zones’, make everything less fixed, and therefore giving Turkey possibility to expand without using violence, that would attract uncomfortable world’s attention. In the Israel-Palestine zone is pretty much the same: there have been episodes of intense violence, but the core of Israeli invasion is being made by slowly eroding Palestinian territories, by seizing metre after metre. And, well, it’s clear that this would happen in the case of a neutral zone too. Plus, if we consider that the external superpowers will help the powerful country in question (as NATO with Turkey, more or less), neutral zones can be nothing but facades.
[2016-03-13 11:13:48] <WikiLeaks> Emmy, it is not fair, but unless Greece installs Russian or Chinese bases on those Islands or something equally bold it is going to lose them bar Turkey being seriously weakened elsewhere.
[2016-03-13 11:17:49] <WikiLeaks> Strategically it should make a settlement at the moment Turkey is weak and Greece is strong. But that won’t happen due to Greece’s political structure. So the settelment will come when Greece is at its weakest and Turkey is at its strongest.
[2016-03-13 11:22:03] <WikiLeaks> Erodgan and company are intent on going back to pre-1914 borders as much as possible.
[2016-03-13 11:30:35] <Emmy B> Russia has never been serious neither will they be now. No idea about China. in 1770 (read Orlof) Greeks handed it on the plate, no Russia took what they wanted from Turkey after encouraging insurgency and revolution in Greece as a distraction, then dropped Greeks like a hot potato. In 1917 lost in their own revolution Russia was the first to sign peace treaty with Ataturk prompting the other ‘great powers’ of the time to scram in competition with the other to sign peace treaties with Turkey leaving Greek army in the middle of Anatolia fighting alone, a complete defeat that led to the catastrophic Lozanne treaty of 1923. In Yalta, they sold off Greece outright to the West despite having a very loyal communist led national army on their side. That is why I don’t think they are serious. If only Russia had been more decisive in the Cyprus issue against Turkey perhaps they could have been taken seriously, who knows, but they didn’t. They still could, they don’t.
[2016-03-13 11:32:56] <Emmy B> you mention 1914, well, it reminds me more of 1918.
[2016-03-13 11:49:28] <Emmy B> Then in the treaty of Moudros in Lemnos Ottoman Empire was broken up and 2 years later in 1920 The Treatie of Sevres articles 62 and 64 mentioned the creation of Kurdistan. Soon after the allies peace making and the defeat of the greek army meant there was no one to make the new Turkey comply with such articles. The Kurdish issue has reached certain maturity today. We are watching what will Russia will do, will they be successful in getting the Kurds to sit around the table at the UN peace negotiations for Syria? Will they clench the deal for a Syrian Kurdish state? They have invited Dimitras (Kurds in Turkey) to open offices in Moscow, will they follow through or will they damp them once they get what they want in Syria?

[2016-03-13 21:28:23] <M> And of course, still riding WikiLeaks’ coattails.
[2016-03-13 21:30:23] <WikiLeaks> After over five years having worked for three weeks!
[2016-03-13 21:31:33] <M> I guess “Buzzfeed contributor” just doesn’t have the same finesse. 😛
[2016-03-13 21:32:54] <WikiLeaks> It is impressive that we leave such eddies behind us that passing flotsam like Ball can drift along in it for 5 years.
[2016-03-13 21:46:14] <M> Yes. It does say something quite extraordinary about WL’s influence. It’s just unfortunate that opportunists are able to exploit it.
[2016-03-13 21:48:23] <WikiLeaks> It seems like it has ended a poor option for mos tof them.
[2016-03-13 21:52:17] <WikiLeaks> Even DDB who got the ‘most’ out of it is a reviled figure now in his own community, ecking out a 5th rate poorly paid talk for a regional germany company every few months and relegated to being a house husband who nevously answers the door.
[2016-03-13 21:55:54] <WikiLeaks> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/OutportReportNL/status/709235896734846976 Epicly amusing confusion:
[2016-03-14 00:09:57] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/_VoiceRepublic/status/709271247830515712 Voice Republic didn’t get the Courage Foundation talk. Hopefully someone else did — it sounds like it was quite good. Haven’t heard back from LoganCIJ whether they recorded it or not.
[2016-03-14 00:47:15] <Emmy B> I got an apology e-mail from the Charity IBA who employ Peter Penfold the GBP 50 heckler.
[2016-03-14 00:50:55] <voidiss> LOL, WL! Some time ago, I used to write small stories for personal pleasure and many of them were WL-inspired.
[2016-03-14 00:51:07] <voidiss> And there was a minor character, DDB-like, who was depicted exactly as “a house husband who nervously answers the door”.
[2016-03-14 00:51:19] <voidiss> That was my personal revenge for all smears that were even able to confuse me in the first period of my support. Fuck DDB.
[2016-03-14 00:52:01] <voidiss> Re Courage talk, it was great, yes! Lauri extensively explained his case and even drew a parallel with Apple vs FBI,
[2016-03-14 00:52:13] <voidiss> in terms of being obliged to decrypt something, and the possible consequences of Apple defeat on individuals, not just corps.
[2016-03-14 00:52:24] <voidiss> Anyway, focus of the discussion was the need to remove barriers between whistleblowers and hacktivists, and ensure same protection to both.

[2016-03-15 23:58:19] <M> The trailer isn’t great, but the script is truly terrible. People have discovered a four-page over-the-top orgy in the script and they’re going bonkers over how awful it is.
[2016-03-16 04:31:06] <LibertarianLibrarian> Wow, I’d actually forgotten DDB existed since he disappeared after The 5th Estate bombed. People like him and Ball are so pathetic. It’s similar to the celebrity – stalker mentality only more self’-serving.
[2016-03-16 04:32:26] <LibertarianLibrarian> Great to see the continued pressure on the UK and Sweden to obey the UN ruling.

[2016-03-16 22:14:10] <Emmy B> Greek gov might fall
[2016-03-17 05:16:24] <WikiLeaks> Em, still happening?
[2016-03-17 08:43:00] <Emmy B> Crisis avoided for now. Junior gov partner ‘Independent Greeks’ convened a meeting and decided to support the government but they demand Refugee petty minister muzalas resignation over his error to call FYROM ‘Macedonia’ in public.
[2016-03-17 09:01:33] <Emmy B> Everyone is calling FYROM Macedonia, he got carried away and made a simple mistake for which he has apologised. The problem is not so much the name but the irredentism coming from FYROM with territorial claims and rhetoric identical to the 1940’s Bulgarian Macedonian ‘state’ established by Burgaria in WWII. For those who do not know, Bulgaria was part of the Axis in WWII and one of the three occupying forces in Greece together with Italy and Germany. The Bulgarians were the worst of the three in occupying Greece because they materialised their strategic goal to access to the Aegean Archipelago. During the earlier 20th century Balkan Wars. Greece militarily defeated Bulgaria and so the newly liberated from Ottoman rule became part of Greece. Then there was an agreed exchange of population between Greece and Bulgaria as a means to bring ‘stability’ which happened. In WWII Bulgaria as part of axis took the opportunity to be extra brutal as part of ethnic cleansing efforts to annex the area for good. After the war they paid reparations to Greece. That is why the FYROM rhetoric is so difficult to accept. On the surface everyone is talking ‘what’s in a name?’ thinking Greece is unreasonable. But the issue is complex.
[2016-03-17 09:34:43] <Emmy B> No one in Greece is challenging FYROM’s right to sovereignty self rule or borders. The collapse of the Iron curtain was looked favourably at home in the 90’s as finally Greece would be able to trade with its northern neighbours. No one anticipated the irredentism and nationalistic bravado of the past that had dominated early 20th century geopolitics and state formation would be coming back to life as a result of the breakdown of Yugoslavia. 2.5 million of its southern inhabitants declared self rule. Great but why would they chose to alienate 20% of its population that is Albanian (they are not Slavs) by identifying with the Greek Macedonian identity whilst they are not Greek. They claim ancient Macedon was not Greek as if the two are mutually exclusive, a historical ignorance of mammoth proportions “We call greek all those who share our culture” was the definition of Greeks in ancient time (common language, religion, traditions, trading relations) but that world had dozens of kingdoms, city states, islands without formal state structure. Some shared alliances and others fought bitter wars between them. Phillip of Macedon was the first with the ambition to unite all Greeks under his Kingdom and Alexander the Great realised this ambition then went on to conquer other territories, the rest is history. To conclude, you could be a Greek and not a Macedon (eg you could be a Thracian Greek like Thukididis or an Athenian Greek like Pericles, a Spartian Greek like Leonidas) but you could not be a Macedon without being Greek.
[2016-03-17 09:43:33] <Emmy B> apologies for the long rants but you see it all ties in with the geopolitics of our era. I will put some links here in case anyone would like to read the issues. Could this issue bring down the government? Well I don’t think the minority party ‘Independent Greeks’ would make such a fuss if it was not important for their long term electoral survival. On the other hand it shows the pressures this government is under when practically nothing goes its way. If a simple error has led to such crisis, the writing is on the wall.

[2016-03-20 09:53:30] <WISE Up Action> Planning to send hard copy through the post. I’m not sure whether to cut it down – it’ll be four and a half sides as it is now – and I haven’t tried to make it shorter so far. Also hasn’t got links yet – I’ll do them in the letter as citations at the end – but will add them in here for reference shortly.

[2016-03-20 13:55:06] <WISE Up Action> You’re welcome to use any of it, Em, but I haven’t published it so you can’t reference it exactly if that’s what you mean? Not sure why you want to? Can’t you just use the info? – There’s no need for any crediting if that’s what you had in mind? You’ll just need to wait till I’ve done links so you can give citations/refs.

[2016-03-21 12:09:10] <WikiLeaks> WISEup: Suggest “deprivation of liberty” instead of ” de facto detention “
[2016-03-21 12:12:09] <WikiLeaks> This quote: “Human rights law, the treaty body law is binding law, it is not discretionary law, it is not some passing fancy that a state can apply sometimes and not in the others”
[2016-03-21 12:12:17] <WikiLeaks> should say who it is from
[2016-03-21 12:13:19] <WikiLeaks> Human Rights Watch should be prominently cited
[2016-03-21 12:13:35] <WikiLeaks> They are AI’s biggest competition
[2016-03-21 12:14:11] <WikiLeaks> ” artists, law makers and politicians, Nobel Prize winners and human rights organisations” should be reversed in order and “artists” removed.
[2016-03-21 12:16:05] <WikiLeaks> Side note: “It is often noted that once Human Rights organisations become prestigious, they are cautious about criticising their own governments. ” actually this is likely to be the other way around. But no need to mention that.
[2016-03-21 12:16:31] <WikiLeaks> AI also receives funding from UK gov.
[2016-03-21 12:25:37] <WikiLeaks> Letter is great, but suggest cutting it by 50% or senior executives won’t read it.
[2016-03-21 12:26:01] <WikiLeaks> either that or creating a half page executive summary
[2016-03-21 12:40:42] <WISE Up Action> Yes, that’s a good idea. I haven’t edited it down at all yet. To put the bullet points (eg) separately would make sense. The bullet points and the ‘text’ or thrust of the letter actually work to obscure each other atm, I think..
[2016-03-21 12:41:11] <WISE Up Action> There are no links or citations yet.
[2016-03-21 12:42:35] <WISE Up Action> I’ll be putting them in.
[2016-03-21 12:48:05] <WISE Up Action> I’m sure there’s plenty of dead wood too – amazing what you find you can do without when you get down to a serious edit. I’ll aim to cut it significantly but retain the structure and thrust of it.
[2016-03-21 14:00:44] <WikiLeaks> Structure is fine, except, as you say, where the bullets rival the text.
[2016-03-21 17:54:49] <WISE Up Action> Btw, Greta – I love Auden x

[2016-03-29 05:28:13] <WikiLeaks> We need to avoid a repeat of AKAWACA with JA4ME
[2016-03-29 05:29:07] <WikiLeaks> There are certain similarities in the psychological profiles of the women behind both.
[2016-03-29 05:32:59] <WikiLeaks> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/JA_4_Me/status/714787442885267456 For example
[2016-03-29 05:34:07] <Emmy B> Ok will support hashtag excersizing caution since we don’t really know them well enough or long enough. Graphics amazing though and someone certainly has the gift of the gab!
[2016-03-29 05:34:08] <WikiLeaks> She’s clearly highly motivated but please try to make sure she’s not a single point of control/failure.
[2016-03-29 05:35:10] <WikiLeaks> The issue is more along the lines of if she goes rogue with that domain/social media accounts, how can the damage be minimised.
[2016-03-29 05:39:29] <WikiLeaks> She’s in berlin so there are some supports for her as long as she is there.
[2016-03-29 05:40:01] <Emmy B> A very ambitious beginning but very well done, i will make further enquiries blumoon cutie had something to say at some point that I did not
[2016-03-29 05:40:37] <Emmy B> Quite remember…
[2016-03-29 05:41:55] <Emmy B> She was at the logan symposium Ping! Greta did you meet her there?
[2016-03-29 05:55:33] <voidiss> No, unfortunately didn’t, I discovered she was there only after. What happened with AKAWACA? #JA4me seems a great initiative, at least it has legs, and the website looks amazing. If I have to be sincere, I got the impression that Suzie is a bit running her own show, but still, I don’t know her, it may just be a wrong impression. What is wrong with that particular tweet? I mean, I don’t know what ‘psychological profiles’ we’re talking about since I wasn’t here when AKAWACA thing happened, what’s the problematic issue that may cause her to go rogue?
[2016-03-29 06:04:56] <Emmy B> Oh akawaca was a group of great supporters in Oz who supported WL/JA but at the time the WL party was launched there they were invited to participate like other supporters groups. Sadly (to my mind) this was a grave mistake. One thing is activism another is party politics. There was a fall out and WACA went public abandoning the project at a crucial time, and damaging the election campaign irreparably.
[2016-03-29 06:06:12] <Emmy B> To go into further details would only open old wounds you can google wikileaks party, 2013
[2016-03-29 06:24:39] <Emmy B> Re ja4me it is simply too early to say, WL is right to be cautious, strongly motivated people are so creative, and this has sprang out of nowhere and going 100 miles an hour. Let’s hope when the tough gets going sensible hats will stay on 🙂
[2016-03-29 06:57:29] <Bean> pretty sure that tweet was a joke to highlight the issue/Obama’s hypocrisy
[2016-03-29 06:59:15] <Bean> a central intention of the campaign is not having control centered in any one person – and is not a political party – but of course time will tell!
[2016-03-29 07:29:33] <Emmy B> Thanks Greta! Good observations. Thanks Bean yes, time will tell.
[2016-03-29 07:49:22] <M> Bean – Yes, which is why I joked in response. 😉
[2016-03-29 07:57:09] <M> I wish the #JA4Me website had a more positive color scheme. It looks like JA is being chased by apocalypse zombies. The grey is so grim.
[2016-03-29 08:21:46] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/NickdMiller/status/714769171687600128
[2016-03-29 08:35:44] <WikiLeaks> Bean: We love the campaign, but if there is no overt structure there is a covert structure. A lot of ‘leaderless’ rhetoric is psycological cover for people who are very concerned about power gradients. This sensitivity to power can come from a desire not to be bossed around, but it can also come from another place. The first step to power is to stop others having power over you. The second step is to have power over others. In this case there are key assets such as twitter and the domain registration. Someone has these credentials and whoever does can exercise their person whims.
[2016-03-29 08:35:51] <WikiLeaks> personal.
[2016-03-29 08:37:33] <WikiLeaks> Twitter, DNS, bank accounts etc, in this way create power problems, turning ‘leaderless’ movements into FBI movements, e.g Sabu.
[2016-03-29 08:39:26] <WikiLeaks> m, we don’t mind the aesthetic. It’s clear based on presentation this is not going to appeal to the middle class, but rather the lumpen prolitariat and teenagers. That’s OK, since it is hard to have a campaign that appeals to both.
[2016-03-29 08:45:54] <WikiLeaks> Actually, the campaign should recognise that constraint and seek to use it to its advantage.
[2016-03-29 08:48:58] <WikiLeaks> In the case of AKAWKA these key assets, once developed though our “support”, were then exploited by castro to wage a personal vendetta on JA to demonstrate her leverage. As leverage increases people expect concessions from us. We can’t be in that position.
[2016-03-29 09:03:22] <voidiss> So what could be the strategy to avoid this centralization of key assets? Creating separate groups with some active #JA4me supporters and feed that channel in case of a ‘gone rogue’ eventuality? The management of the Twitter account is going to rotate, it’s a good sign…
[2016-03-29 09:12:28] <LibertarianLibrarian> Good thought, Greta. We just need to keep an eye on them and watch for signs of power-hungry personalities. Try to head then off and encourage the better aspects.
[2016-03-29 09:52:09] <Emmy B> Considering I swallowed MGT’s lies hook line and sinker for a considerable time, and did his bidding for x number of months all in the name of supporting WL/JA I don’t think I am the best judge, in fact, many of us were deceived, so I am taking WL concerns raised here seriously I really need to look into this properly. Also important to do this person justice. I will investigate. Thank you very much guys and girls <3
[2016-03-29 09:56:18] <WikiLeaks> Just wish to repeat how important this is to understand many people in ‘equalitarian’ movements “The first step to power is to stop others having power over you. The second step is to have power over others.”
[2016-03-29 10:02:21] <WikiLeaks> Through ‘no leader’ or ‘we are all equals’ rhetoric, those who have authority, deservered or not, can be pulled down to the same level as the ambitious. Then once the power aspirtant has one milimetre of covert advantage they’re the boss of all. Should people challenge this state of affairs they can be described as attempting to gain leadership and surpressed.

[2016-03-29 17:05:34] <Bean> wl – fully understand the power issues related to the leaderless concept – these are of course fundamental and recurring issues with regards to organisation of political movements – various different forms of organisation and their consequent crises of power will no doubt continue to unfold! my philosophy is to participate with good faith if the intention is positive, whilst always maintaining vigilance around the power issues. other folks are better equipped than I to deal with specific strategies as my energies are focused elsewhere (how’s that for a cop out? typical ‘artist’ – ha)
[2016-03-29 19:34:48] <Bean> from what i understand passes to the ja4me assets are not being held exclusively by one person and that, apart from practical aspects of this, it would seem to be a significant measure of goodwill with regards to wl

Sweden has signed a general agreement on mutual legal assistance with Ecuador. The prosecutor has submitted a request to interview Julian Assange at Ecuador’s embassy in London. This document was recently sent from the Swedish Ministry of Justice to the Office of the Prosecutor-General of Ecuador. It is not possible to estimate when a response can be expected.
When all necessary permits and arrangements are ready, the interview will be performed by the supporting prosecutor to the case, Chief Prosecutor Ingrid Isgren, together with a police investigator.”

[2016-04-02 02:27:48] <Emmy B> In this article is mentioned that Greek Gov circles say gov is angry also concerned whether telephone interception happened in Athens and the implications (ie interceptions going on)

[2016-04-02 02:34:59] <Emmy B> The gov meeting is over gov Olga Gerovasily spokesperson reportedly said “«Η κυβέρνηση ζητεί εξηγήσεις από το ΔΝΤ σχετικά με το εάν η επιδίωξη δημιουργίας συνθηκών χρεοκοπίας αποτελεί την επίσημη θέση του Ταμείου». my translation “The Greek Government asks IMF to explain if the Fund’s official position is to pursue the creation of conditions of bankrupcy” that refers to parts of the conversation where Tomsen implies they should wait till the summer with the evaluation so that by then Greek gov is against the wall financially and therefore more ready to accept conditions.
[2016-04-02 02:35:32] <Emmy B> This is not the best site, I will look for others http://www.zougla.gr/politiki/article/ektakti-siskepsi-sto-maksimou-meta-tis-apokalipsis-wikileaks

[2016-04-02 03:01:54] <Emmy B> Keep talking Greece Blogger offers an excellent summary so far plus some ‘Miss Marple’ comment on WL transcript, aparently who did it spelt on of the names in the way a Greek would spell it. http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2016/04/02/explosive-wikileaks-exposes-imfs-strategy-of-delays-in-review-talks-aiming-to-trigger-greeces-default/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+KeepTalkingGreece+%28Keep+Talking+Greece%29
[2016-04-02 03:53:57] <Emmy B> Its reported that Tsipras has had discussions with the President of the Greek Parliament as well as the President of the Hellenic Republic on the WL revelations and will be contacting heads of Greek political parties as well as foreign heads of states.
[2016-04-02 03:55:40] <Emmy B> Tsipras will also be writing to Christine Lagard on the matter reported here: http://www.megatv.com/megagegonota/article.asp?catid=27371&subid=2&pubid=35777036
[2016-04-02 03:56:12] <Emmy B> Mega TV is one of the largest private TV stations in Greece
[2016-04-02 04:09:38] <Emmy B> Interestingly, Justice Minister Paraskevopoulos also attended meeting which makes me think that concerns of interceptions where also part of the agenda
[2016-04-02 04:24:01] <Emmy B> The President of the Hellenic Republic Pavlopoulos (politically coming from the right wing party of New Democracy – the Karamanlis fraction) has been brought in by the Syriza/Anel coalition, the minority partner of the coalition Anel, Mr Kamenos being the power broker, is extremely active than any recent Greek President. Syriza gov has called more than any other greek gov political party leaders meetings under the President of the republic. On this occasion Tsipras contacting him on this issue signals Prime Minister will seek co-ordination with heads of all political parties. What’s cooking? President Pavlopoulos suggested ESM (European Stability Mechanism) can replace IMF. !!!
[2016-04-02 04:29:01] <Emmy B> Earlier this year (Jan16) he stated from an official visit to Frankfurt, ‘Serious and emblematic institution the International Monetary Fund might be, but does not know the workings of Europe and the euro, stated President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and supported the acquisition of similar technocratic infrastructure by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).’

[2016-04-02 13:23:52] <Emmy B> Greek gov sources are quoted to say: “Μέχρι στιγμής, δυστυχώς, το ΔΝΤ δεν αξιοποιεί την ευκαιρία να διαψεύσει ότι η στρατηγική του είναι η πρόκληση συνθηκών πιστωτικής ασφυξίας στην Ελλάδα, λίγο πριν το κρίσιμο για την Ευρώπη Βρετανικό δημοψήφισμα” My Translation: “Up till now unfortunately, IMF does not make the most of the opportunity to deny that its strategy is to provoke a credit asphyxiation in Greece a little before the British referendum”

[2016-04-03 05:50:59] <Emmy B> The Leader of the opposition Kiriakos Mitsotakis (New Democracy Party, son of an ex Prime Minister, brother of ex Foreign Minister Bakogiannis) has questioned the wisdom of Greek government in handling the WikiLeaks release. Greek gov issued statement accusing him of defending IMF and even raising issues of telephone security and confidentiality of call conversations: https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=el&u=http://www.protothema.gr/politics/article/567032/suriza-kata-nd-gia-wikileaks-ehei-analavei-tin-uperaspisi-tou-dd/&prev=search

[2016-04-03 06:06:16] <Emmy B> Apparently, not only New Democracy but ‘Potami’ as well expresses sceptisism about the time and content of the WL release (a supposedly social democrat party -not really-) headed by an ex journo who launched his party on the eve of the collapse of Pasok a few years ago, he calls the party ‘river’
[2016-04-03 06:17:04] <Emmy B> [Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/716615503087845379/716615503326932992/gpTahoe_.jpg Greek Government sources quoting a WikiLeaks Tweet Here https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=el&u=http://www.naftemporiki.gr/story/1087575/oi-epomenes-kiniseis-tis-kubernisis-meta-tin-apokalupsi-wikileaks&prev=search
[2016-04-03 06:41:13] <M> In which Forbes tries to downplay WikiLeaks release, but doesn’t do a very good job of it. http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/04/03/greece-and-the-imf-that-wikileaks-release-is-pretty-much-what-we-all-knew-anyway/#35fa0f38151e
[2016-04-03 06:57:28] <Emmy B> It is fascinating to watch the political maneuvering in Greece over the revelation, Greek gov trying to make something of it (do they push the right way to get what they want?) the Greek opposition trying to use the release for their own purposes as well as (some parties) using deflective techniques being more concerned about the origin of the tape rather than the content.
[2016-04-03 07:00:08] <WikiLeaks> Wait what. Was Ferguson at Logan?
[2016-04-03 07:15:12] <voidiss> Not CIJ’s Logan, UC Berkeley’s.
[2016-04-03 07:24:06] <M> Yes. UC Berkeley’s Logan is like the evil twin of CIJ’s. Nearly all MSM speakers. http://investigativereportingprogram.com/logan-symposium/logan-2016/speakers/
[2016-04-03 07:27:58] <WikiLeaks> Funny to see Fergy, who met JA once 5 years ago, still obsessing.
[2016-04-03 07:30:39] <WikiLeaks> He was making a feature film for Hollywood, his first, on WL; het got into bed with David House, of all people, who he made the star of his script (which we got hold of). He was beaten to market by 5th estate, so the studios pulled the plug on him. So his first Hollywood feature film was an epic failure.
[2016-04-03 07:31:28] <M> Ah yes, I remember that script.
[2016-04-03 07:31:44] <M> Hah, from his Wikipedia: “On May 1, 2011, The New York Times reported that Ferguson had agreed to make a film about Wikileaks founder Julian Assange for HBO Films. According to the IMDB the film is scheduled for release in 2013.”
[2016-04-03 07:31:55] <WikiLeaks> Rather than accepting that he was too slow, he appears to be trying to divert the loss onto JA.
[2016-04-03 07:33:03] <WikiLeaks> The script was nasty and stupid.
[2016-04-03 07:34:00] <WikiLeaks> Stupid as in it didn’t make sense as a story.
[2016-04-03 07:34:31] <WikiLeaks> Nasty as in it made JA into a scheming cult leader.
[2016-04-03 07:36:24] <M> Whatever it takes to make JA a villain!
[2016-04-03 07:38:27] <voidiss> Oh, not even very original, though. Anti-JA guys seem to love the cult thing so much, I’d like to know how invented it first.
[2016-04-03 07:38:41] <voidiss> Their talking points are so repetitive.

[2016-04-03 07:57:30] <Emmy B> Some articles in Greek (very few) explore the potential origin of the audio recording, especially as New Democracy party had a sceptic’s view on the release, not on the authenticity but on the usefulness of such release. “WikiLeaks revelations: Who recorded Thomsen-Velkouleskou?” https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=el&u=http://www.protothema.gr/politics/article/566881/apokalupsi-wikileaks-poios-kategrafe-tomsen-velkouleskou/&prev=search

[2016-04-03 08:30:37] <Cabledrum> The court hearing (me vs. MGT at OLG Frankfurt) takes place on 21 Apr
[2016-04-03 08:33:45] <Cabledrum> Meanwhile, I got a written pleading from MGT’s lawyer, regarding the criminal charge against MGT for perjury. This at least means that the public prosecutor has started an investigation against him.
[2016-04-03 08:41:43] <Emmy B> About time how long ago did you file the complaint?
[2016-04-03 08:42:56] <Emmy B> Keeping my fingers cross for the 21st x
[2016-04-03 09:06:14] <Cabledrum> We’ve filed the complaint in July 2015, after he lied under oath in the injunction case against me. MGT claimed that he is not responsible for http://wikileaksforum.comhttp://support-julian-assange.comhttp://wikileaksforum.comhttp://support-julian-assange.com

[2016-04-03 11:01:09] <Emmy B> Still, the most amazing news and a sign the whistleblowing continues 🙂
[2016-04-03 11:05:09] <M> There’s something frustrating about the size comparison to Cablegate when the archive isn’t public.

[2016-04-03 11:16:23] <WikiLeaks> The size difference is nonsense.

[2016-04-03 11:17:42] <WikiLeaks> We have a role in PP, but can’t say what it is yet.

[2016-04-03 11:21:16] <voidiss> Can’t wait!
[2016-04-03 12:04:32] <Emmy B> I have just confused several people thinking it is a WL release, and I am going round unconfusing them – time to switch off computer and have a break…the brain is foggy.
[2016-04-03 12:13:47] <WikiLeaks> please don’t go around unconfusing
[2016-04-03 12:21:01] <Emmy B> ok I am like a cat chasing its tail hahaha

[2016-04-04 04:11:13] <Emmy B> My Translation: Official announcement by Maximou (seat of government/presidential palace): After meeting government executives under the PM with objective to discuss the development of the negotiations, the following announcement is published: “The strategy of prevarication in negotiations so that conditions of asphyxiation are created just before the British plebiscite is indeed very silly. A silly thing that we are obliged to avoid. The negotiation must be concluded without unrealistic demands and extra measures, further than the ones defined by the agreement of last July. As far as security matters are concerned, the Greek government re-assures one more time that Greece is a absolutely safe country, furthermore, certainly from countries in which the overwhelming majority of the leaks from WikiLeaks has happened”. (it means the US where IMF is based)

[2016-04-05 10:39:35] <Emmy B> Pasok Politician Evagelos Venizelos petitioned Greek Parliament to have EYP (Greek secret services) give testament in a public inquiry whether they were involved in the WikiLeaks IMF release. His request was rejected “no one has ever claimed Greece was involved in the interception” said the presiding officer of the Justice Dept committee https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelos_Venizeloshttp://www.antenna.gr/news/watch?cid=_xz1j_nejr4_uc%3D
[2016-04-05 10:42:29] <Emmy B> But such efforts are clearly in an attempt to politicise against the Syriza gov, they are not serious claims.
[2016-04-05 10:50:27] <Emmy B> Having now followed for several days the release in Greece it is extraordinary how people are using it in all kinds of ways it has certainly been discussed everywhere in media/newspapers. I think personally we get an idea of how transparency (albeit in this occasion forced) can bring about a more active political process of negotiation and impact as more and more people are engaged in the dialogue, trying to make sense of the particular process and when the revelations really mean or how they are used.
[2016-04-05 10:56:47] <Emmy B> Athens stock exchange was affected as financiers interpreted revelations in a particular way (i.e. prospects for Greek economy) other opinions vary, saying IMF positions expressed in Leak is in favour of Greek position, others say the opposite, then you have opinions that Greece is being crushed in other more powerful players game or that once again democracy fails as no Greek gov cn really affect outcomes. And then, this surge to look abroad ‘What did the German press say?” “what did Biden say”? what did the Commission did not say?” etc etc round and round, every single political party took a position…

[2016-04-09 00:57:29] <WISE Up Action> Emmy, WLF old main account still suspended? Has MGT bailed out?
[2016-04-09 02:00:26] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/m_cetera/status/718725083322314752 Offered a nice, critical look.
[2016-04-09 02:06:21] <Emmy B> @ W – I could not tell you why the account is suspended Twitter has never taken action to over 80 individual complaints I have filed in the past against @wikileaks_forum account. Twitter has suspended MGT’s account once in 2014 and another time in Sep 2015 in response to Chris’s complaints. They have also been suspended once perhaps due to copyright violation, as they used an artwork without permission.
[2016-04-09 02:09:05] <Emmy B> I believe MGT de-activated account in Feb 2016 as a response to his legal troubles as a lot of the defamation was done against Chris and her family was in twitter, but he also has left proof of his identity there, as I document here: https://greekemmy.com/2016/01/30/mark-goeder-tarant-is-the-owner-of-the-fake-wikileaks-forum/
[2016-04-09 02:15:01] <Emmy B> But he did re-activate for a few days in order to momentarily attack my efforts to inform people in UK about the paid 5th of Feb heckler. Personally I think he will be back, note that when Twitter permanently suspends they say so and this is not the case here.
[2016-04-09 02:23:32] <Emmy B> He might have masterminded the suspension himself in order to protect his account from being ‘lost’. That is to say, if an account remains de-activated for certain amount of time then the handle becomes available again to be used by another user (you may not be aware but this is what happened to Christine Assange’s original account, when she abandoned it, it was eventually picked up by MGT or his friends and used as a harassing account, and it is now on my list of troll accounts recommended for blocking) By becoming suspended he is in permanent limbo, being inactive but without the risk of losing the handle. As the twitter account is certainly in the midst of Chris’s case against MGT, ultimately what we observe happening to it, reflects directly the outcome of the legal case and how MGT wishes to maneuver himself legally.
[2016-04-09 02:24:43] <Emmy B> @ M thanks for all the wonderful resources.
[2016-04-09 02:30:15] <WISE Up Action> Thanks Em. Yes I was actually thinking about whether the account handle could be taken up. Not missing him at al 😉

[2016-04-09 17:20:26] <M> Article in Politico: The Coming Era of the Mega-leak. Interesting to note how many of the leaks mentioned WL had involvement in. http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/04/panama-papers-the-coming-era-of-the-mega-leak-213802
[2016-04-10 01:56:11] <Emmy B> Shining Sarah https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIp5QpAFU_8
[2016-04-10 02:16:04] <voidiss> IMHO, maybe in this case it’s better to avoid RT/Sputnik’s articles on WL comments about attacks on Putin etc. They tend to twist the meaning, as if WL said the whole Panama Papers were set up to ruin Russia and all those things, while actually they only pointed out to the US funds and some outlets’s focus on Putin. Otherwise it’s like playing the game of those who say WL is FSB or other crap like that. No?
[2016-04-10 02:40:48] <Emmy B> I think you have to follow your instinct with these things Greta, personally I share all kinds of things that I find of interest. Even distortions and misrepresentations have an interesting story to say. I am generally more careful with what I share about JA’s troubles, rather than WL publications.
[2016-04-10 02:42:48] <Emmy B> But even there it is very interesting when Daily Mail claims David Blunkett uses JA’s troubles to attack Goldsmith. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3531757/David-Blunkett-accuses-mayoral-hopeful-casual-sexual-violence-defend-Wikileaks-founder-battle-escape-extradition.html
[2016-04-10 02:45:33] <Emmy B> from a political perspective.
[2016-04-10 02:49:37] <Emmy B> It combines the political battle for the Mayoral elections, the inter-tory conflict over EAW (recall backbencher revolt) and by implication the Brexit issue and finally, to my mind most interesting Daily Mail’s own euroscepticism as instead of bashing Assange as they often do, they use his story as the umbrella under which to weave their own agenda in this case.
[2016-04-10 02:59:26] <Emmy B> Reading on we can learn that DB was the Home Office Labour Minister who introduced the EAW under the pretext of terrorism, see here: http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/blunkett-pushes-eu-extradition-terrorists-1972098
[2016-04-10 03:02:49] <Emmy B> and he was also involved in another aspect of extradition law, the US UK extradition treaty where he admitted http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1308478/David-Blunketts-startling-admission-UK-US-extradition-treaty.html
[2016-04-10 03:07:17] <Emmy B> Even for EAW he admitted: “There is room for improvement with the EAW,” Blunkett told the Commons home affairs select committee this month. “When we agreed to the system we believed that people would act rationally.” http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/dec/14/julian-assange-european-arrest-warrant

[2016-04-10 17:42:16] <M> More from Ryle on WikiLeaks: “Referring to WikiLeaks, Mr. Ryle said, “We’re trying to reclaim ground that they stole — or, they took,” which mainstream journalism allowed because “we got lazy and sloppy and arrogant about what we were supposed to do: shine light into dark places.”” http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/business/media/panama-papers-leak-signals-a-shift-in-mainstream-journalism.html?_r=0

[2016-04-12 02:32:29] <WISE Up Action> I like Bethany Horne, although she has taken to be v critical of Correa. She ‘s maybe finding out that jumping in with the Graun isn’t all she thought it would be.

[2016-04-15 13:14:17] <Emmy B> I am getting DMed by people who express concern about WL silence for 7 days now, even e-mails. HOPE ALL IS WELL and Twitter has not blocked them !
[2016-04-15 13:21:44] <M> WL has plenty of means of communication. If something was seriously wrong, they can certainly get the message out.
[2016-04-15 13:31:07] <Emmy B> Yes thank you M, their FB page is active but it makes ppl anxious as it is not sth we are used to, they have never done it before, as if they are on strike.
[2016-04-17 21:03:25] <Emmy B> Very important: First Commercial operator I am aware of who includes donations to WikiLeaks as a charity donations offer in their hotel bookings strategy linked to ppayment in Bitcoin https://coinreport.net/hotelgo24-com-allows-charitable-donations-using-bitcoin/
[2016-04-18 01:24:16] <Emmy B> Greece: The Open Project by the @ThePressProject promises later on today to throw light to the Bailout Negotiations in Greece in an unprecedented manner. It hints that the volume of information will be substantial. Will it follow the WikiLeaks model? I shall keep you posted.
[2016-04-18 01:24:39] <Emmy B> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/ThePressProject/status/721973889962741760
[2016-04-18 01:26:14] <Emmy B> Tweet says: Enough with “information” – Everything out in the light! In two hours we Open up the Negotiation with the #OpenProject
[2016-04-18 09:44:43] <Emmy B> Part of the #openproject @ThePressProject refers to the #WikiLeaks #IMF leak with a complete translation of the WL transcript into Greek and a short analysis (very much in the lines of JA’s editorial). The Link is here: http://www.thepressproject.gr/mou/index.php?aid=93002
[2016-04-18 09:47:55] <Emmy B> The #OpenProject is a release of the original negotiating text between Greece and Troika. From what I understand bits of it (but not in its entirety) has appeared at times in Newspapers. @ThePressProject attempts to present it in its entirely, both in Greek and in English with the demand that the negotiations should not be made in the dark but in the open and place the original document on the Government Transparency Website ‘OpenGov’.
[2016-04-18 09:50:34] <Emmy B> In English the negotiating document is called ‘Memorandum of Understanding’ or MOU.
[2016-04-18 09:54:17] <Emmy B> The Press Project has paired off with an English speaking partner: Forbes and they link to this article/analysis :”Greece’s Latest Bailout Negotiations: Kicking The Can Again” http://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2016/04/18/greeces-latest-bailout-negotiations-kicking-the-can-again/#1b3a9510809c
[2016-04-18 10:14:56] <Emmy B> Here is the link in in open project that offers the option to view the original text in English: http://www.thepressproject.gr/mou/index.php?aid=92868
[2016-04-18 10:18:24] <Emmy B> Yes, they have done a ‘WikiLeaks style’ release presenting an original document although this draft MOU is not a whistleblowers’ leak, (from what I understand) it is just that neither the Greek government, or the Troika, nor Greek/foreign MSM had ever published it. The Press Project is offering a lot more analysis than the WikiLeaks releases (understandable as this release is very much country specific).
[2016-04-18 15:43:38] <WikiLeaks> John Jones was killed this morning.

[2016-04-19 02:03:41] <Emmy B> I am not sure which WikiLeaks release the article is referring to (rusty 46 birthdays brain) but seems important.
[2016-04-19 05:40:20] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/m_cetera/status/722404079541096450 Separate from the Asylum series, it seems?
[2016-04-19 06:36:09] <WikiLeaks> Name change.

[2016-04-19 06:57:37] <M> Hm. Better name, I think. More inclusive.
[2016-04-19 06:57:44] <WikiLeaks> Yes. It says it is ‘post wikileaks’ in the subtitle. Then ‘cover the period when WikiLeaks..’ in the body. And claims JA and LP are not on good terms.
[2016-04-19 07:12:06] <Emmy B> I am glad they changed the name so BBC’s propaganda ‘Asylum’ will not come up in the Google searches for LP’s documentary 🙂
[2016-04-19 07:16:18] <WikiLeaks> We’re not big fans of the new name, but we can see that it is more accessable. ‘asylum’ is also now over-coupled to the northern african/middle east refugee crisis.
[2016-04-19 07:18:46] <Emmy B> It’s great it is showing in Cannes 🙂
[2016-04-19 07:22:48] <M> My only issue is its a bit generic. Sounds like an adaptation of the board game. Or could get confused for the Bollywood thriller. 😛 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(2007_film)
[2016-04-19 09:18:14] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/ladiyfestsheff/status/722368089245876225 The predictable and boring attack on JA ahead of his talk in Sheffield. (Interesting to note however they have switched to using CN or “content note” instead of TW for “trigger warning,” probably because the latter now carries the censorship connotation.)

[2016-04-20 07:08:27] <voidiss> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/adamjohnsonNYC/status/722777805029797888 This piece sounds almost comical in its blunt propaganda effort. The title, oh my god, the title. Why didn’t he write something like “let’s kneel in front of our powerful and merciful saviours”? But apart from that, it’s quite interesting to see how the DOJ decided to investigate on the Panama Papers that *casually* didn’t expose many US connections (at least in the published part). And also, worth noting this:
[2016-04-20 07:08:50] <voidiss> Ops, here’s the link: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/20/thanksful-us-willing-global-policeman-panama-papers
[2016-04-20 08:04:02] <M> Journos kept hinting the US revelations were coming, but at this point it seems that was just an attempt at appeasing the critics.

[2016-04-21 04:49:24] <Cabledrum> The court hearing is over. The court didn’t give any hint. So we have to wait for the judgement (in a week or two)

[2016-04-21 07:54:38] <Cabledrum> WUA: No. The court didn’t give any hint (as usual). Now, the court could decide to convene another hearing (which is unlikely) or they can make the judgment. We have to wait…
[2016-04-21 08:26:30] <WISE Up Action> Ok thanks CD. Hope his perjury gets exposed. All the best.

[2016-04-23 05:35:10] <Emmy B> The OpenProjectLeaks by The Press Project has now Tweeted their step by step instructions in Greek on how to leak to WikiLeaks. https://www.thepressproject.gr/mou/wikileaks.php
[2016-04-23 05:35:45] <Emmy B> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/ThePressProject/status/723851811174662144
[2016-04-23 05:38:05] <Emmy B> It has been done very carefully and accurately as far as I can see, the only thing I can raise, there is no culture of whistleblowing therefore, there is no word to describe whistleblowers, in the translation the word ‘informant’ is used which in Greek as well as in many other languages has negative connotations due to historic references, ie WWII etc.
[2016-04-23 05:41:47] <Emmy B> There is an expression in Greek ᾽κρούω τον κώδωνα του κινδύνου᾽ ‘ hit the danger bell’ which means ‘to alert to danger’ which would be more fitting and positive but has no noun that I can think of.
[2016-04-23 05:44:35] <Emmy B> No Greek could ever aspire to be ‘an informer’ the word is stained. We need a neologism for ‘a whistleblower’

[2016-04-26 07:22:31] <M> Oh don’t worry, it’s more annoying than anything. Her information is largely incorrect so I don’t feel threatened. I did report her for spam.
[2016-04-26 07:24:19] <M> She is obviously craving attention/trying to provoke me, so the best response is to just ignore her. She’ll get bored eventually.
[2016-04-26 07:33:39] <Emmy B> She is going round all supporters trying to defame them just like MGT did, disguised with deceiving appearance. She did the same in the flesh, although she can be nice when she want to. I followed the same approach and yes, she eventually moved on.
[2016-04-26 09:27:31] <WikiLeaks> Emmy: In dutch whistleblower is ‘klockkenluders’ (or something like that), which means “bell ringer”.
[2016-04-26 09:30:48] <WikiLeaks> What about for the prophets? Revealers?
[2016-04-26 10:06:12] <Emmy B> Πληροφοριοδοτης = the one who gives information Πληροφοριοφωτης = the one who brings information to the light
[2016-04-26 10:07:15] <Emmy B> In Greek you can easily create a new word to express a new idea. I will suggest to them, although it might be a bit too radical a proposal to create a new word into the Greek world 🙂
[2016-04-26 10:07:46] <Emmy B> Thank you! x
[2016-04-26 10:08:23] <Emmy B> (in this way there is no connotation, no prior historic association)
[2016-04-26 10:09:14] <Emmy B> The first word I mention is synonymous to informer the second people will ask, what does it mean?
[2016-04-26 10:19:06] <WikiLeaks> It looks good.
[2016-04-26 10:30:15] <Emmy B> Thank you! I just sent Gerasimos an e-mail let’s hope they block Sands and consider my idea.

[2016-04-28 23:37:57] <Emmy B> Public Servants in intelligence often need protecting from themselves methinks
[2016-04-28 23:40:03] <Emmy B> As unaccountability of power which they possess leads to rampant abuse and destruction including self-destruction.
[2016-04-29 01:29:20] <Cabledrum> The prosecutor has terminated the proceedings against MGT for perjury. We will contest this decision at the Prosecutor General.
[2016-04-29 01:29:52] <Cabledrum> This is the third criminal investigation against MGT that has been terminated without charge, despite clear evidence. Obviously, MGT enjoys some “special protection”.
[2016-04-29 08:43:47] <Emmy B> Thank you very much Cabledrummer for letting us know, justice will at some point catch up with him, he cannot always evade it. We stand by you <3
[2016-04-29 10:29:52] <LibertarianLibrarian> Best of luck contesting it. Does make you wonder who is pulling strings behind him.
[2016-04-29 10:57:20] <Cabledrum> Yes, it makes me wonder. Obviously, my notion of the independence of the German judiciary is somewhat too utopian
[2016-04-29 14:06:30] <M> Apparently a Zimbabwean teen escaped the Zimbabwean London embassy by outrunning the police. https://www.zimeye.net/julian-assange-escapes-embassy-british-police-flies-to-zimbabwe/
[2016-05-01 15:18:23] <M> A note: The end of the month (May 28/29) will mark 2000 days JA has been arbitrarily detained. A good time to plan things and bring awareness.
[2016-05-01 21:20:18] <M> Obituary for John Jones written by Geoffrey Robertson http://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/may/01/john-rwd-jones-obituary?CMP=share_btn_tw
[2016-05-03 05:56:58] <Emmy B> The £50 heckler saga: I just received the latest from his (now ex employers) “This is to notify you that Mr Peter Penfold has been stopped from raising fund on behalf of IBA charity by the management. Any charity activity carried out by Peter Penfold should be reported to the police.” Hopefully he will now stay away from the vigil and Knightsbridge.
[2016-05-03 07:31:03] <Cabledrum> I have finally lost the court case against MGT. The judgement cannot be appealed.
[2016-05-03 07:31:07] <Cabledrum> This means that it is illegal under German law to use the photo of MGT. I have to remove the photo from my server immediately.
[2016-05-03 07:31:14] <Cabledrum> Also it means that I have to pay approx. 18000 Euros (which I do not have).
[2016-05-03 07:31:28] <Cabledrum> I don’t know any further details yet (I have to wait for the written judgement) but it smells very fishy. Even my lawyer says that he “doesn’t understand the world anymore.”
[2016-05-03 07:31:47] <Cabledrum> MGT has won both cases against PC and against me. 3 criminal complaints against him failed, despite clear evidence.
[2016-05-03 07:31:54] <Cabledrum> This is extremely frustrating. All attempts to stop MGT’s illegal actions have failed.
[2016-05-03 08:02:45] <Emmy B> I am very sorry for this Cabledrummer, I will assist with fundraising to cover the costs. <3
[2016-05-03 08:15:41] <WikiLeaks> Cable: when did you lose?
[2016-05-03 08:15:51] <WikiLeaks> And PC’s second case, when was that lost?
[2016-05-03 08:16:24] <WikiLeaks> Make sure you have your assets in areas which are hard to seize.
[2016-05-03 08:17:14] <WikiLeaks> You might be able to appeal to ECHR or UNHRC, though it will take years.
[2016-05-03 08:17:35] <WikiLeaks> You have max six months to do so.
[2016-05-03 08:18:26] <WikiLeaks> “doesn’t understand the world anymore.” — that’s either MGT’s protections as a result of being an informant, or your lawyer not being very good and looking for an excuse.
[2016-05-03 08:22:21] <Emmy B> PC’s second case was not lost. There was a partial win. MGT is been found responsible for all content on his site, ie Chris has proved her case, albeit Judges were not 100% sure on the twitter responsibility, so this part has not been won but has not been ‘lost’ either.
[2016-05-03 08:23:32] <Emmy B> But his twitter is also suspended so in effect there is progress there too. Albeit I could not give you any particulars a this mo.
[2016-05-03 08:24:26] <Emmy B> @ Cabledrummer, I think let’s wait for the details of the judgement and see what can be done! x
[2016-05-03 11:05:30] <Cabledrum> I lost in Nov 2015 before LG Frankfurt (regional court) and now (21 Apr) before OLG Frankfurt (higher court).
[2016-05-03 11:05:44] <Cabledrum> The court ruled that the verdict cannot be appealed before the Federal Supreme Court (“BGH”).
[2016-05-03 11:06:13] <Cabledrum> “doesn’t understand the world anymore.” — No, not a bad lawyer but a *very* strange and unexpected decision of the court.
[2016-05-03 11:06:43] <Cabledrum> Along with PC’s case and the discontinued criminal proceedings it simply seems to be perversion of justice
[2016-05-03 11:08:17] <WikiLeaks> The purpose of the ‘justice’ system is to enforce the power of state instution and the property rights of the wealthy. Any benefits in another direction are random.
[2016-05-03 11:09:19] <WikiLeaks> But they do tend to have good marketing. For instance, lawyers will tell the press that “this case will be decided on the law” because they know that it is unlikely to be decided on the law and they want to encourage the judge to decide on the law.
[2016-05-03 11:10:42] <WikiLeaks> Similarly, they tell people to dress well, because if you don’t, judges will decide that you are further from the property-class/state, whose interests they are really engaged in trying to protect.
[2016-05-03 12:30:28] <Cabledrum> Similar to media censorship, I really would like to understand how it actually works. Do the judges decide on their own because they are biased against anything with the “WikiLeaks” label? Do they believe to do the right thing, even by violating the law? Or has someone from the ministry of the interior “recommended” how the judgement should look like?
[2016-05-03 12:54:50] <Emmy B> Document everything and submit to a public depository for posterity, everything will eventually come out in the wash. Only a matter of time.

[2016-05-04 05:55:39] <Emmy B> oh well!
[2016-05-05 04:30:28] <Emmy B> Is anyone being followed by Omar Todd?
[2016-05-05 04:31:02] <Emmy B> [Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/728185230973087748/728185231002480641/-ugq7VvI.jpg
[2016-05-05 04:33:15] <Emmy B> The tweet does not make sense and the link (a professor’s profile) does not include the quote tweeted http://www.latrobe.edu.au/she/staff/profile?uname=sangelides
[2016-05-05 04:34:38] <Emmy B> oh one of his accounts follows me.
[2016-05-05 07:51:48] <Emmy B> Greek Member of Parliament Papachristopoulos mentions the IMF WikiLeaks leak in a video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzK_7qJEywM
[2016-05-05 07:55:17] <Emmy B> “What else could the government do” he says, “when it rolled out the dialigue with Thomsen and Mrs Velculesku, at this precise moment [the gov] fights the IMF tooth and nail, how would otherwise be able to ‘burn’ him” (he means discredit Thompsen).
[2016-05-05 07:56:48] <Emmy B> But the exact words do not mean admission the gov leaked the phonecall. It could very well mean that the gov chose to ‘adopt’ the leak and use it to the fullest rather than dismissing it and distancing itself from it as any previous government would have done.
[2016-05-05 08:17:49] <WikiLeaks> @WikiLeaksParty is tweeting pro-pedo material? wtf.
[2016-05-05 08:37:50] <Emmy B> I think it was meant to be a quote from an article but the link doesn’t correspond, linking to the profile of a professor, I contacted Omar Todd via Twitter
[2016-05-05 08:38:28] <Emmy B> He said :
[2016-05-05 08:39:46] <Emmy B> He doesn’t that much anymore but he will ‘suss for sure’ I don’t know what this means I
[2016-05-05 08:40:09] <Emmy B> I asked him to take a look as it does not look right
[2016-05-05 08:41:15] <M> The link goes to a professor who does research on child sexuality, so it is not a wholly unrelated link. It’s very creepy.
[2016-05-05 08:53:54] <Emmy B> That’s why I am flagging it up
[2016-05-05 09:02:56] <Emmy B> I sent another message to Todd I don’t know who tweets from the account
[2016-05-05 12:04:46] <Emmy B> Omar deleted the tweet.
[2016-05-05 12:32:36] <Emmy B> [Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/728306420303732739/728306420333084672/JzQ7akrj.jpg The Greek MP re-tracted saying he was misunderstood
[2016-05-05 12:33:44] <Emmy B> As I thought he explains he meant that the GR gov raised the WL release at the highest levels and used it to its advantage.
[2016-05-05 12:35:27] <Emmy B> but with the same breath he continues: “I therefore state that the interception was done by WikiLeaks, it is impossible for EYP (Greek SS) to have made the interception …”

[2016-05-09 05:16:34] <Emmy B> What can I say? Love both, how wonderful <3
[2016-05-09 05:18:26] <voidiss> Yes!! <3
[2016-05-09 06:46:52] <LibertarianLibrarian> That is absolutely adorable!! I miss my cat; she was with me for 14 years before she passed away. I hope ‘Embassy cat’ has the same long, happy life with Julian. 🙂
[2016-05-09 11:43:14] <Emmy B> The kitten has gone viral! from India to Ireland…the world!
[2016-05-09 11:44:13] <LibertarianLibrarian> Awesome!!
[2016-05-10 01:34:50] <Emmy B> MGT’s second twitter account @supportJAdotcom has been using my bunny Avatar. After a Copyright Complaint to Twitter the latter has removed the picture from MGT’s account.
[2016-05-10 04:28:27] <Emmy B> The fact that DAG has taken such a strong interest in the Lauri Love case is highly disconcerting to me. That Courage Twitter keeps re-tweeting someone who has proven to follow the gov line on all matters WL/JA with such zeal is also of great concern.
[2016-05-10 04:32:07] <Emmy B> The RIPA ‘safeguards’ are hardly such, that the civil court decision celebrates RIPA is also greatly disconcerting. Where does the IP bill (which I hear will pass) stand in relation to RIPA? are we clapping today whilst this court decision only a tactical move for less safety in the future? One has to be an expert to even carry an opinion whilst the rest of us can scratch their heads.

[2016-05-10 09:26:34] <Emmy B> Let’s see what we’ll see
[2016-05-10 17:28:02] <WikiLeaks> What is CourageFound retweeting? Dag?

[2016-05-10 17:33:28] <WikiLeaks> Hard choice. But better to save Lauri and feed DAG.
[2016-05-10 17:33:41] <WikiLeaks> As vulgar as he is.
[2016-05-10 17:57:52] <LibertarianLibrarian> That’s true.

[2016-05-11 11:22:09] <voidiss> Oh, god… I’ve just seen. It’s terrible, I’m deeply sorry. 🙁
[2016-05-11 12:13:26] <WISE Up Action> So sorry to hear about Michael Ratner. Oddly, was thinking about him earlier today.
[2016-05-11 15:15:48] <LibertarianLibrarian> Oh Wow!!! I am so sorry to hear about Michael Ratner!! That’s a shock. He did amazing work. What a terrible loss!!
[2016-05-12 06:20:53] <WikiLeaks> It is. Three lawyers died so far. On the plus side, no-one else.
[2016-05-12 07:16:10] <LibertarianLibrarian> Let’s hope no one else including lawyers.

[2016-05-14 14:29:37] <WikiLeaks> the ban story is more important than the page
[2016-05-14 14:30:15] <Emmy B> ok
[2016-05-14 14:30:27] <WikiLeaks> Or better make it non-public
[2016-05-14 14:32:55] <Emmy B> sorry too late I deleted it permanently but better someone does create one page (non public) to secure the name so no troll grabs it.

[2016-05-14 18:35:14] <LibertarianLibrarian> Facebook is evil in my opinion. Holding a name vs trolls privately would be OK but o/w better to run with the badness of Fb instead. But just my own opinion.

[2016-05-17 00:06:43] <Emmy B> @ philJames2014 the prolific anti-wikileaks troll experiences its first twitter suspension due to copy right infringement of my photos. Yet another proof Twitter protects the $ rather than HR (81 complaints for fake wlf harassment and privacy complaints ignored). Our vigil street photographer Mem was seriously affected by ‘PhilJames2014’ messing up his work as to delete his twitter account, there is some justice with this suspension but it may not be long lived.

[2016-05-19 09:30:37] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/m_cetera/status/733321143164239872 Collected reviews so far
[2016-05-19 09:31:22] <WikiLeaks> the reviews are being changed to be nastier as editors become involved
[2016-05-19 09:31:58] <WikiLeaks> cine vue and variety both had strictly positive reviews (from a WL perspective) then they were silently changed.
[2016-05-19 09:32:10] <WikiLeaks> please archive.is them as you see them
[2016-05-19 09:32:30] <M> OK
[2016-05-19 09:34:23] <WikiLeaks> note on the film we are not giving any position, since it is not helpful to endorse it or to disendorse it. Also it is going to be changed between now and distribution.
[2016-05-19 09:35:14] <WikiLeaks> but it is helpful to push the positive (about us) reviews and the social prestigine of ou rpeople being at cannes

[2016-05-19 09:39:43] <M> Reviews seem generally good, positive toward WL, but there’s the usual “JA is a narcissist” trope etc. From the reviews it seems the Swedish case wasn’t represented in the best manner, either.

[2016-05-20 12:57:18] <Emmy B> Perhaps away from the toxic UK Guardian journos can produce some good work?
[2016-05-20 12:57:44] <M> He’s a film guy, not a news journo, so that may be partly why it’s not so bad.
[2016-05-20 13:11:02] <Emmy B> Which could mean his reputation as a film journo among his peers possibly a strong reason not to be tempted into the gutter other Guardian journos have enthusiastically jumped into with both feet…
[2016-05-21 03:11:31] <WikiLeaks> It is the journos that interface with power that are the problem, since they know where to suck.
[2016-05-21 03:35:48] <voidiss> The majority of the bad reviews writes about the same quotes or the same sections of the film – likely the openest to spin and ambiguities.
[2016-05-21 03:35:54] <voidiss> Almost as if they all copy one from the other in order to present a homogeneous smearing portrait.

[2016-05-22 12:13:13] <Emmy B> For about a week now in my Google search ‘News’ results for ‘wikileaks’ articles, several articles appear in the search results from the online UK newspaper ‘The Independent’. Not only there is no reference in the article to WL but also When I search for ‘wikileaks’ on the page in general again there is no reference (eg, a tag or a part article etc). This is a regular occurrence in the general search results (non ‘News’) but extremely rare for ‘News’ search selection and as it is only ‘The Independent’ that is doing it I am curious why and how it is done. Any ideas, would be good.

[2016-05-31 23:14:27] <Emmy B> @ M to my great disappointment youtube poster cut the Q&A session (about an hour) from his you tube video as you can see from the screenshots above. *Goodbye kitty cameo*
[2016-05-31 23:15:08] <Emmy B> perhaps it is reposted under different url, haven’t checked.
[2016-05-31 23:18:56] <M> No she’s still in there, at 3:59:15. 🙂 The user just edited out the breaks between panels.
[2016-05-31 23:19:54] <M> It’s a bit confusing because (at least for the time being) if you scrub through the video time, the preview image is incorrect.

[2016-06-06 11:26:20] <Emmy B> The moment ‘risk’ premiers at Cannes and from what I read he is a protagonist, we get this defamation of Jacob Applebaum, so sad 🙁 but more importantly I wish him strength to what he has to face in the next few months.
[2016-06-06 13:48:09] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yeah, this nastiness has spread far & fast including some people I otherwise liked. People are too quick to believe these kinds of accusations, esp. if the target is well-known and/or has a difficult or strong personality that isn’t politic. The timing & the type of accusation just reminds me terribly of what was done to Julian. Hard to distinguish truth when it’s all shaded by rumor and unprovable he/she saids. If he did do something, they are real legal avenues that should’ve been pursued in private not public accusation campaigns.

[2016-06-09 17:38:13] <LibertarianLibrarian> This looks like another witch-hunt smear campaign. We’ve seen those before. Makes me suspicious.
[2016-06-10 05:32:27] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, I agree Hazel, but it’s tough to believe people you trusted will turn on you and when even the most innocent behaviors are twisted, it’s difficult to fight. Jill B’s story is a case in point. How absolutely innocent an interaction got turned into an abuse story is insanity.

[2016-06-10 07:01:54] <Emmy B> This is just unbelievable stuff! The Steinitz woman wrote about WLsup mobbing MGT which was false but to this day she has not apologised. This though is true mobbing.

[2016-06-10 07:23:17] <Emmy B> we saw it to an extend unfold at the fake forum, traumatising many, but the only (and I hope I am not sounding inconsiderate here) when you break up a group of skilled people these people tend to spread further and further and become cells that metastasise so in one way breaking a structure is destructive but could also spearhead something new.

[2016-06-11 13:01:49] <Emmy B> Thank you! Well I never Nigel Farage calls Hilary Clinton a crook and then he says something like (if I am not mistaken) : “I worked for the company at the time of watergate and what I saw…” what does this mean? any ideas?

[2016-06-11 15:28:33] <LibertarianLibrarian> Agreed. We’ve seen all this before.

[2016-06-13 13:22:00] <Emmy B> I just asked for my name to be added onto the letter of solidarity for Jacob.
[2016-06-14 05:39:55] <LibertarianLibrarian> I did as well, Emmy.
[2016-06-14 06:01:48] <Emmy B> I have been having some exchanges with Bluey on the topic, she has written some stuff, some of which made me laugh http://www.twitlonger.com/show/nmgsob
[2016-06-14 07:03:38] <Emmy B> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/ThePressProject/status/742708944737579009
[2016-06-14 07:07:25] <Emmy B> They First Came for Assange The Press Project has just tweeted their article about it, (fantastic!) with a link to original Campaign site https://freeassangenow.com/
[2016-06-14 07:37:45] <Cabledrum> Christine Sands again:
http://sofiawilen.com/https://twitter.com/USAF_m_cetera/status/742721293108281344
[2016-06-14 07:39:33] <LibertarianLibrarian> Blue’s tweet is great. I almost got fooled by that Sands twitter handle. Need to watch out for it!
[2016-06-14 13:05:46] <Cabledrum> After the prosecutor terminated the proceedings against MGT for perjury, we have lodged a complaint against this decision at the Prosecutor General. Now, the Prosecutor General has rejected our complaint.
[2016-06-14 13:07:17] <Cabledrum> Key point: In the eyes of the prosecutor, perjury is not punishable, as long as it doesn’t affect the judgement.
[2016-06-14 13:57:13] <Emmy B> scandalous!
[2016-06-14 13:58:40] <Emmy B> So Christine Sands continues to target M, hmm…
[2016-06-14 14:00:16] <M> Apart from the account name, she isn’t doing anything. I think she got bored because I never responded to her harassment.
[2016-06-14 14:03:11] <Emmy B> no one retweets her stuff is only able to occasionally fool someone, but your tactic seemed to work.

[2016-06-17 03:26:26] <Emmy B> @ M Is it possible to have a summary of local times for broadcasting the live stream on Sunday? I think you had done a page in the past using world clock or something like this? Time is upon us, I assume it is 19:30 London Time but how about ppl in US or Australia, how will they know to tune in?
[2016-06-17 03:27:31] <WikiLeaks> Yes. Good point. Can you find a useful workclock link?

[2016-07-14 13:39:51] <Emmy B> McDonnell’s quote echoes JA’s ‘the superpower of the accused’ recent analysis
[2016-07-14 22:40:34] <Emmy B> why France Again?
[2016-07-15 05:28:46] <WikiLeaks> 5m muslims in the country and constant adventurism in the middle east/northern africa.
[2016-07-15 08:05:46] <Emmy B> Yes, but this is not new, they have been imperialistic for ever, in the 20’s they were very much involved in carving up the Ottoman empire and got eg Syria as their cut before making peace accord with Kemal Ataturk, or their involvement in Africa has been constant in Algeria, during their civil war, but even before, in the 80’s French security forces were involved. Still, in comparison to what other Western countries have been involved in, to me is surprising France is the one currently carrying the brunt. So much to understand…
[2016-07-15 09:17:23] <Emmy B> perhaps all this history makes them a lot more vulnerable now
[2016-07-15 13:44:58] <Emmy B> not at all

Turkish helicopter with eight people landed in Alexandroupolis.
The helicopter belongs to the Turkish police. According to preliminary information sent out distress at 11:45 since morning and landed in Alexandroupolis at 11:51.
Reportedly, occupants are seven soldiers and a civilian. They have “pulled out” their grades from their uniforms, so it is unknown yet who they are and what position they hold.
It is likely to be people who have defected. Greek police is at the airport, and over the airport space a pair of F-16 fighter provide air support.” http://www.onalert.gr/stories/praksikopima-sthn-tourkia-elikoptero-sthn-aleksandroupoli/50936

[2016-07-16 05:25:19] <Emmy B> “Why political asylum requested by the coup participant Turks are “hot potato”!
II. Karvounopoulos 16/07/2016 | 14:31 37 Views
“Hot potato” the request of the seven military and a citizen of Turkey for political asylum. The Turks landed in Alexandroupolis helicopter Blackhawk, (photo from e-evros.gr) hoping that this will escape the consequences of their involvement in the attempted coup against Erdogan.
The government spokeswoman Olga Gerovasili said that the eight arrested accused Turkey of violating the constitutional legitimacy and participation in coup aiming to overthrow democracy and hinted that it will be very difficult not to be extradited. She pointed out that all legal procedures will be adhered to but she stressed twice in a television interview in ERT that the offenses for which they are accused are very serious.
The point is a hot potato. An and the decision seems to be one way. The Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was the first western politician who publicly backed Erdogan and even at the time when it was not clear which side would prevail in Turkey. It is rather difficult now to refuse extradition of eight Turks seven military and a civilian.
But because in Turkey they have already begun to seriously discuss the imposition of the death penalty even for some of those involved in the coup attempt, there is an issue! The EU does not “cover” us to extradite defendants in countries that may condemn them to death.
Militaire.gr sources indicate that there is communication between Athens and NATO, in order to manage the issue.”
[2016-07-16 05:25:39] <Emmy B> http://www.militaire.gr/%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%AF-%CF%84%CE%BF-%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%B9%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C-%CE%AC%CF%83%CF%85%CE%BB%CE%BF-%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%B6%CE%B7%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%8D%CE%BD-%CE%BF%CE%B9-%CF%84/
[2016-07-16 07:32:49] <Emmy B> The military arrested across Turkey after the coup attempt amounted to 1,563, an official said.
The issue is not only the number involved. The issue is who did Erdogan ‘unwrap’.
▪I Turkey has captured fighter pilots, Commanders Special Forces amphibious force, and also the Governor of the landing craft of the Aegean fleet.
▪O Erdogan “removes teeth” from throughout the administration of the Aegean fleet on the basic accusation that they attempted to kill him.
▪Also it is not the army that performs the arrests in the army but the anti-terrorist service, this shows how problematic the situation is.
The situation in Turkey is still not completely under control.

[2016-07-17 03:53:36] <Emmy B> interesting analysis of coup attempt from kurdish perspective: http://kurdishquestion.com/article/3289
[2016-07-17 03:56:38] <Emmy B> [Card-summary] http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/120138-160716-egypt-blocks-un-security-council-from-issuing-statement-condemning-turkey-coup from Egyptian perspective:
[2016-07-17 08:56:49] <Emmy B> As long as Erdogan remains in Istanbul or Constantinople the easier he fits the ‘Sultan image’ and that is to say the last sultan. One has to ask why he does not return to his seat of government, Ankara, Perhaps he has actually been de-throned and prefers to be near the exit, the millions who’ve followed the path before him into Europe for safety, let us see whether there will be a helicopter available to take him to safety when the time comes and what will be its nationality.
[2016-07-18 01:26:45] <Emmy B> Thousands attend/ed Gulen schools and associations are they all going to be targeted by Turkish state? Remember how bad things can get: progrom 1955 in Instabul ‘cleansed’ thousands, properties confiscated, businesses destroyed. This is not good.
[2016-07-18 08:19:01] <Emmy B> Because of the political/military situation in Turkey any release could act as a release valve for a lot of tension. This may be very positive on the ground in Turkey long term but short term release may be spi
[2016-07-18 08:19:21] <Emmy B> nned one way or another
[2016-07-18 08:36:13] <WikiLeaks> Erdogan will spin it as a Gulen plot
[2016-07-18 09:04:42] <Emmy B> although he pushes that line Gulen=terrorist organisation etc etc perhaps the real danger to his power is the people closest to him within his party who perhaps wish to retain some of their power and see him as a liability. I have no idea if indeed Gulen had anything to do with the plot, or his sympathisers did, how could I, but Erdogan has marked them as his enemy and so it is. The Gulenist supporters sympathisers, if we believe the US embassy cables as an accurate source is into millions within Turkey, imagine how many have gone to the schools, have been in Gulenist trade associations or charities, Erdogan paints with the brush of terrorists a very large part of the population, it is extraordinary how he chose to act with purging thousands from positions of state, in the legal,judicial profession, the army, the police, kind of disintegrating the state and terrorising a huge part of the state apparatus and the population, introducing a chaos element within his own ranks. The enemy within, instead of ‘The Kurds’, ‘The Greeks’ ‘The Armenians’ ‘The Laz’ . I wonder how he can sustain this in the medium or long term. I get the feeling things are very much in flux. Neither can we assume that the external powers to be are currently idle. Considering the importance of Turkey militarily, Erdogan is now a liability for them too, I don’t know why Egypt comes to mind, perhaps because they were the only ones in UN not to condemn the coup attempt.
[2016-07-18 09:05:54] <Emmy B> it is a complex situation hopefully the new release will help many to understand the situation and in fact, calm things down
[2016-07-18 09:06:32] <Emmy B> it may also offer distraction and focus minds
[2016-07-18 09:07:20] <Emmy B> at the mo everything is frozen by violence or the threat of violence
[2016-07-18 09:07:38] <WikiLeaks> Listing Gulen as a terrorist group a month ago would have put many in a dangerous position.
[2016-07-18 09:07:47] <WikiLeaks> So coup could be gulen related.
[2016-07-18 09:09:34] <Emmy B> it is inevitable, event if he himself does not pull the strings, the thousands associated with the movement have been active state actors for years, in fact they were for years Erdogan’s power base supporting his rise to power, as per US Embassy cables
[2016-07-18 09:17:06] <Emmy B> it is just the scale of Erdogan’s intention to criminalise potentially hundreds of thousand of people… on the other hand, Kurds have been at the receiving end of such discrimination for decades upon decades, previously Armenians, Greeks ethnically cleansed so society it seems is willing to accept such mass scale criminalisation of groups of people? but difficult to understand really what is happening. Trying to make parallels with other countries… de-baathification perhaps in Iraq, but it was done by an external occupying force, or the exclusion from power of Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt… but again it is different.

[2016-07-18 12:34:57] <Emmy B> so far western press has not mentioned the upcoming release the Independent, The Guardian, the Telegraph, the Mirror, no US publications have come up in my searches, which is surprising as in the UK at least most front pages of newspapers were all about Turkey. A controlled narrative is the name of the day perhaps, due to US/UK interests? just bizarre, But Reuters India, AlJazeera, some Turkish sites have reported it.

[2016-07-25 14:11:38] <M> Awful. There’s a correction at the bottom of the article saying that it reflects that WL didn’t publish it, but it’s still the same article, save a few words. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zeynep-tufekci/wikileaks-erdogan-emails_b_11158792.html

[2016-07-25 22:07:09] <Emmy B> The very useful WL press release on Google warrants is not easily listed in the site’s ‘news’ and therefore visibility is poor. Here: https://wikileaks.org/google-warrant/press.html
[2016-07-25 22:14:16] <Emmy B> In relation to attempts by Clinton and allies to link WL with Russia on the latest release, the implication is (apart from obviously attempting to discredit/weaken the release’s impact), that it feeds into the Grand Jury ‘Espionage’ investigation. however flimsy the ‘Russian conspiracy’ is, the Grand Jury investigation role is to criminalise through a legal conspiracy.

[2016-07-31 16:34:18] <M> Interesting that the emails are being debated, but I think GOP was stretching a bit. They referenced three emails, but they are all part of the same chain. Basically, GOP is trying to blame Dems for the economical loss that North Carolina faced after it blocked a pro-trans bill that would have allowed people to use bathrooms based on the gender they identify with (rather than the sex on their birth certificate).

[2016-08-05 12:19:12] <Emmy B> Although Bamford does not specify where he got access to Snowden rare archive of docs it does not exclude it might have been during his visit to Moscow, potentially damaging for Snowden and friends. Otherwise interesting article.
[2016-08-05 12:31:04] <Emmy B> In Turkish but even with Google translate it is evident author attempts to use WikiLeaks in the ‘FETO’ polemic but also somehow taint WL with regards to selectivity of publications in Cablegate, its previous partnership with Taraf (Gulenist paper) but I cannot go further due to the poor translation: http://www.haber7.com/yazarlar/taha-dagli/2063665-wikileaks-fetoyu-neden-es-gecti

[2016-08-05 12:37:26] <Emmy B> If WL is to continue with future AKP e-mails, it has been reported in the Turkish Press that the anti Gulen purge has started inside the AKP.
[2016-08-05 12:42:28] <Emmy B> This article mentions proceeding against four former AKP ministers: http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/turkiye/580014/AKP_li_4_eski_bakana_bir_kotu_haber_daha.htmlhttps://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=tr&u=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/turkiye/580014/AKP_li_4_eski_bakana_bir_kotu_haber_daha.html&prev=search
[2016-08-05 12:44:48] <Emmy B> The Business insider also mentions something similar http://www.businessinsider.com/r-turkeys-ruling-akp-orders-purge-of-members-linked-to-gulenist-terror-group-2016-8

[2016-08-07 12:48:35] <Emmy B> wasn’t something like this in ‘the fifth estate’ first screen script leaked to WL? an iranian scientist passing nuclear info onto US or did I dream it?
[2016-08-07 13:19:13] <WikiLeaks> It was.
[2016-08-07 13:24:48] <Emmy B> perhaps I should listen to that Sam Adams award panel video… in perhaps Oxford…
[2016-08-07 13:28:26] <Emmy B> perhaps the script writers where being helped… given access to state secrets imitating life only to throw WL under the bus… or a coincidence
[2016-08-07 13:41:16] <Emmy B> The video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vQNWYnQjUE
[2016-08-07 13:42:22] <Emmy B> at 9:40 when JA talks about cultural bias/ propaganda
[2016-08-07 13:43:48] <Emmy B> and at 11:11 about the script
[2016-08-08 03:26:39] <Emmy B> I have been retweeting a lot of Turkish articles with ‘Feto’ in the title. The Turkish gov coined term the term FETO. The letter ‘T’ stands for terrorist. By using the term we implicitly accept the Turkish gov definition for these potentially hundreds of thousands of ppl. A very clever marketing strategy.

[2016-08-08 10:04:53] <M> Would it be worthwhile to do a fact checker for that Gibney piece? Since it’s in NYT and really chalk full of falsehoods.
[2016-08-08 12:26:36] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/thehill/status/762730610733580288 Not sure how tight this analysis is.
[2016-08-08 12:34:05] <WikiLeaks> Overstated
[2016-08-08 12:34:21] <WikiLeaks> yes. fact-checker, re, gibney

[2016-08-09 11:24:07] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/763047172023738369 Roger Stone story spreading. I don’t think media is seeing this tweet since it’s directed at Mediaite.
[2016-08-09 11:58:43] <WikiLeaks> Stone is a bullshitter
[2016-08-09 11:59:15] <WikiLeaks> Tryng to a) imply that he knows anything b) that he contributed to our hard work
[2016-08-09 12:40:55] <Emmy B> Without knowing anything about the gentleman I get the impression he is mainstream and it is therefore surprising he does not run a mile from entangling himself in the WL story, perhaps if 1000 such ppl where willing to throw their hat in the ring, mudding the waters, the WL Grand Jury will become 1000 times bigger and therefore a lot more ineffective. – Current mood *amused* 🙂
[2016-08-09 12:50:54] <WikiLeaks> He’s Carl Rove’s harsher twin
[2016-08-09 12:53:18] <Emmy B> oh dear! perhaps I should read on him, he is a player then not just a passing actor. Thank you.
[2016-08-09 12:54:27] <Emmy B> The world is vast when you are traveling on WL express 🙂 what I will be reading about next? x

[2016-08-17 05:55:54] <LibertarianLibrarian> Agreed. I’m still stunned by Alison’s behavior. I worked with her a bit and she seemed fine, if a bit young, but sometimes you never know what’s going on in people’s heads. There’s some serious bad stuff going on inside Tor right now.
[2016-08-17 05:57:58] <LibertarianLibrarian> I think going to pursue his degree is a good thing for Jake, actually, gets him out of a toxic situation, but it’s sickening to see this kind of unsupported slander hurt someone who has done so much good. And to lose such a strong voice for freedom.
[2016-08-17 08:36:18] <Emmy B> From where I am sitting they are all young Jenny 🙂 just some have more sense than others perhaps.

[2016-08-17 11:10:49] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/ForbesOpinion/status/765609170036985856 Bizarre article in Forbes. Basically: Russia secretly influences everything (inc. WL) and US should fight back by exposing Russian politicians as homosexuals.
[2016-08-17 13:31:29] <Emmy B> articles claiming malware existence in the WL turkish release: https://github.com/bontchev/wlscrapehttp://www.ibtimes.co.uk/wikileaks-accused-covering-evidence-malware-ridden-email-leak-1576525

[2016-08-17 23:21:27] <Emmy B> Greek Turkophone newspaper milletgazette (I hear financed directly by the Turkish consulate in Komotini in Greece Thrace region where about 120,000 Greek Muslims live) reports that Ecumenic Patriarch Vartholomeos (Turkish state does not recognise the title Ecumenic the equivalent of the Pope for Orthodox Christians) was aware of the Turkish coup and he had found refuge at a near by US base pretending to fly abroad all the while. A very dangerous assertion for his safety and the safety of the 2000 remaining Greek Orthodox Christians of Istanbul as the article suggests he held good relations with Gulen.
[2016-08-17 23:21:50] <Emmy B> http://www.milletgazetesi.gr/view.php?id=5346
[2016-08-18 01:27:27] <Emmy B> [Card-summary_large_image] http://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/opinion/will-ankara-take-aim-at-patriarch-bartholomew/ A perspective in line with the above is presented here: http://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/opinion/will-ankara-take-aim-at-patriarch-bartholomew/
[2016-08-18 01:33:25] <Emmy B> if The Ecumenic Patriarch is expelled or forced to leave Istanbul (still Constadinople in Ecclesiastic terms and the continuous domicile of the ecumenic patriarchy of Orthodoxy the last 1500 years) who is going to host him? perhaps he will find refuge in Athos, the semi autonomous monastic community of Greece https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Athos
[2016-08-18 01:34:15] <Emmy B> (Putin visits so often)

[2016-08-18 01:49:25] <Emmy B> If the Patriarch is killed, another will replace him (he has to be a Turkish citizen already otherwise Turkish state does not allow him to take his position) but if expelled he may be able to finally call a synod to move the seat of orthodoxy elsewhere (it won’t be the US) https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/03ISTANBUL760_a.html

[2016-08-22 09:25:15] <Emmy B> Wrote to London Assembly (see my blog) about JA’s situation, one member has replied: Dear Emilia,
Thank you for your email. I will submit a written question to the Mayor at the next Question Time on September 14th – something along the lines of:
How much has it cost the Metropolitan Police to monitor Julian Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy? Do you think this operation is a good and acceptable use of public money?
He should provide an answer by Monday 20th September and I will let you know.
Best regards,
David Kurten
UKIP London Assembly Member
[2016-08-22 09:27:59] <Emmy B> Although London Assembly has a very narrow remit mainly to scrutinise Mayor’s budget, Mayor is obliged to reply. Sadiq Khan has never took a position on the matter that I am aware of, we shall at least see his position and can follow up with individual letter to the Mayor.
[2016-08-22 09:31:21] <M> Good work. Look forward to hearing the response.
[2016-08-22 09:38:35] <Emmy B> Thank you, the 14th is a wednesday, perhaps we can air our banners outside the London Assembly Building, in question day, let’s see *inspiration*
[2016-08-22 09:39:27] <Emmy B> Question time will be advertised somewhere on their website 🙂

[2016-08-23 01:21:32] <WISE Up Action> Satter is desperately trying to make smoke.
[2016-08-23 03:01:11] <M> Interesting to look through his past tweets re WL. He covered Saudi Cables when they came out, but I didn’t see any mention of personal info concerns (however, I only skimmed his tweets). He seemed to turn against WL after AKP, DNC and has attacked them since.
[2016-08-23 03:11:41] <M> Also note that he is trying to make this a new, recent story (“in the past year”) but Saudi Cables where 95% of claims stem from are over a year old.
[2016-08-23 04:46:09] <WikiLeaks> He’s always ben a rat.

[2016-08-23 13:03:28] <WikiLeaks> He’s the son of David Satter, who is mentioned in our cables. DS is a senior member of the Hudson institute and a well known Russia basher and NSA apologist. He was expelled from Russia in 2008 and 2014. Rafael grew up in Washington DC

[2016-08-30 20:59:22] <Emmy B> An idea just popped into my head that a US PR company co-ordinates the recent attack on WL, imagine if SA finances it, and AP’s Satter is involved. With the amount of RT’s involved of his article, I would not exclude PR co pumping Re-tweets with fakes. This high level of RTs is such a bleep, such a rare thing for an anti-WL article that it reminds me of MGT’s tactics, buying likes, fake followers and fake ‘forum members and statistics’

[2016-09-06 08:29:58] <Emmy B> hm hm
[2016-09-06 09:05:59] <WISE Up Action> Feel encouraged by the preview. Would be a massive flip-flop to then attack JA based on that?
[2016-09-06 09:41:00] <M> Yes. But one never knows with these things.
[2016-09-06 09:41:11] <M> Put the two non-English quotes into Google Translate:
[2016-09-06 09:41:13] <M> TO: There is no common measure to go abroad and keep questioning of a suspect.
MN: This is a sex crime, and we are investigating it the way we normally do.
[2016-09-06 12:57:31] <WikiLeaks> It is positive. That’s why she’s called the press conferece. Damage control. Promote the hell out of it to swedes.
[2016-09-06 13:57:02] <M> Great to hear.
[2016-09-06 14:01:55] <WISE Up Action> Yes, and Swedes seem interested in it – a few have shown interest in past few days. Will be hitting them some more.
[2016-09-06 17:02:51] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/dagensnyheter/status/773303590878404608 This article says the program will discuss the ongoing US investigation into WikiLeaks as well as the real possibility of JA being extradited from Swe to US. It looks like they really did their research.
[2016-09-06 22:36:25] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/m_cetera/status/773394385425825792 3 articles on the program

[2016-09-07 03:39:35] <Emmy B> At the bottom of the second post it says that article is a translation of an Esspressen article.

[2016-09-08 13:08:16] <WikiLeaks> That was cool, em.
[2016-09-08 13:08:36] <WikiLeaks> What did the locals say?
[2016-09-08 14:11:57] <Emmy B> Mixed, we were asked by the guard/policeman to stand away from the entrance so we could not engage with everyone handing flyers but wait for those who came to approach us. Most who spoke to us were journalists who were curious but with short exchanges. SVT journalist very courteous another lady journalist was hostile, 2 women who worked with the police told us we should not be there, it was wrong for us to be there and that someone would come out soon to tell us, then they left, when a uniformed man came out he was alright just asked us to move to the other side. Many took photos or short videos silently, many smiled back, some where happy to see our messages, others enquired with specific questions. One man working with the police (plain clothes) said we should not be protesting at the police as this had nothing to do with the police it was the prosecution who was responsible, I explained that it was Marianne Ny that chose the venue, this police station and that is why we were there, he seemed embarassed.
[2016-09-08 14:16:51] <Emmy B> The place we were sitting was not a thoroughfare, so we were mostly seen by the people who came and left from the building of the police station, mostly the ppl attending the press conference and others who had business with the police station.
[2016-09-08 14:31:22] <Emmy B> I got the impression the location is not used to protests, even gentle ones like ours. I felt we were a surprise, was very pleased with the action and how things went. Only we did not see Marianne Ny herself coming in or out. The building was as big as a palace, there would be many entrances and exists.
[2016-09-08 15:51:15] <WikiLeaks> Sweden is not used to protests full stop.
[2016-09-08 15:51:41] <WikiLeaks> So the shock value is amplified.
[2016-09-08 22:18:12] <Emmy B> Thank you H!

[2016-09-14 02:34:50] <M> Is this being interpreted correctly? People are reporting it shows that they were rewarded these positions for donating, but as far as I can see it could just be documenting who these people are. https://twitter.com/Always_Trump/status/775948729643786240

[2016-09-14 19:19:52] <M> ACLU, Amnesty, HRW calling for Snowden pardon, but didn’t see a peep from Amnesty or HRW re Manning’s hunger strike/suicide charge.
[2016-09-14 23:03:39] <Emmy B> H we carry on regardless
[2016-09-14 23:15:14] <Emmy B> M yes indeed I think perhaps Oliver Stone’s film is a catalyst and an opportunity, if it also become a commercial success then it would help even more, it is the way of the world and I recall what wad said about creating cultural bias surrounding the script of the Fifth Estate…it works both ways. The huge difference between the two Snowden Manning is their degree of Liberty and victimisation, Thx to WL Snowden’s hope for freedom was planted early on, whilst Manning felt the full impact of state fury as was caught by the system thx to Lamo’s betrayal.
[2016-09-14 23:17:18] <WISE Up Action> Re M’s point above, is there any ‘official’ reason why Courage don’t openly support JA?
[2016-09-14 23:20:35] <M> I would think it’d be a bit odd since he’s a founder.
[2016-09-14 23:21:02] <Emmy B> Of course they do but he founded it and he is not a beneficiary, we might have to fund one ourselves for JA
[2016-09-14 23:27:23] <Emmy B> He has the defence fund for WL but they do not do advocacy work for him, like courage does for its beneficiaries, it is his lawyers and supporters individually (eg first support assange, our own modest efforts etc) that are advocating for his release. Here in the UK we are forming as you know JADC Julian Assange Defence Committee, so far just an email list perhaps we should put some more flesh and bones into it.
[2016-09-14 23:30:32] <WISE Up Action> M: yeah that’d be it! Actually forgot that minor fact! 🙂
[2016-09-14 23:36:49] <WISE Up Action> Thanks Em.
[2016-09-15 03:54:06] <WikiLeaks> Last week JA resigned from the Courage board of trustees. He will become a beneficiary instead.
[2016-09-15 04:01:51] <Emmy B> @ WL Wonderful News!
[2016-09-15 07:43:28] <Emmy B> Plenty of ppl on JADC email list will be delighted to support Courage’s efforts with letter writing supportive actions and any other planned initiatives 🙂
[2016-09-15 08:23:15] <WikiLeaks> well, courage has no extra capacity but it will self some time on administration
[2016-09-15 08:23:36] <WikiLeaks> contact courage and see how you can slot it
[2016-09-15 09:53:20] <Emmy B> Ok

[2016-09-16 10:13:51] <WISE Up Action> Emphasising Ny’s role, it’s idiosyncrasies and the criticism of it by legal peers are definitely things we’ll keep highlighting.

[2016-09-20 07:01:57] <Emmy B> As a note, on the 5th of February (UNWGAD ruling and last JA speech) there were MetPol officers present, their cost is not mentioned. Furthermore, MetPol statement regarding covert operation increasing surely has a cost but Mayor’s officers oblivious to it. I also note these Mayor’s officers do not mention that the costs are classified but there are not budgeted as if there is no operation what so ever.
[2016-09-20 07:03:39] <Emmy B> The Mayor did not answer whether he thought the cost was a good and acceptable use of public money. The third answer about the intruder remains unanswered.
[2016-09-20 07:03:50] <Emmy B> I will update the blog post.

[2016-09-20 07:16:33] <Emmy B> Another supporter Elsa has written to Sir Bernard Hogan Howe, on the matter of the intruder asking for an enquiry on why MetPol took so long to respond, if she gets a response I will ask if I can share it here.
[2016-09-20 07:18:05] <Emmy B> Perhaps I should also ask the London Assembly member who asked these questions for further information and clarification, once the third question is answered.

[2016-10-03 09:04:13] <M> One of the most telling things about Clinton supporters/the state of the Democratic Party is how many people responded in *support* of Clinton’s alleged comment about an illegal assassination of JA.
[2016-10-03 09:09:59] <WISE Up Action> Had a ridiculous ding ding argument with a Democrat guy recently. They really can’t see or at least acknowledge what they’ve become.
[2016-10-03 09:15:12] <WikiLeaks> Did you mention how they’ve they have formally merged with the neocons?
[2016-10-03 09:24:18] <WISE Up Action> We were talking about how they treated Sanders. Guy was like ‘he’d never have won, and anyway, he was lucky we allowed him the platform at all’. Party tool. In complete denial.
[2016-10-03 09:29:19] <WikiLeaks> You can argue that, but it is undeniable that people like Kagan, Crystal, Wolfowitz are backing her, raising money for her, and in many cases socialising with her.
[2016-10-03 09:40:23] <WISE Up Action> Bleak.
[2016-10-03 09:47:05] <WikiLeaks> Yes, though it is questionable what the presidency ultimately does other than marketing.

[2016-10-11 00:47:58] <M> She’s been like that toward WL/JA as long as I can remember.
[2016-10-11 04:11:16] <Emmy B> Extremely interesting remark, a very clear indication that both political camps public relations teams drown in overtime time-sheets and there will be a paper-trail of marketing reports, strategies and budget approval requests…
[2016-10-11 04:19:11] <Emmy B> Ofcourse, the most serious anti-WL strategising will be done at darker corners whether in HPGary type organisations or closer to the nastier centres of power. But the current tide is also a strength and with some political centres in US (the greens clearly but also some Bernie Sanders supporters circles) finally vocally pro WL is a wonderfully hopeful thing. I also observe this budding support is inclusive towards WL as well as Manning Snowden ie the enlightening movement of transparency. Good stuff <3

When I met Livitsanos a member of staff in the summer he hinted at trouble but I did not enquire at depth. Let’s hope they will find a way forward and that the appeal for more contributors/members will have an effect.

[2016-10-14 10:13:33] <Emmy B> Unbelievable comments in US politics, both from the Liberal (Green) the Libertarian (Ron Paul), the Democratic Tradition (Carter) and the non conformist Republican (Trump) What remains reactionary is political establishment of all creeds. *Hopeful*

[2016-10-14 12:09:27] <Emmy B> I find it extraordinary that the comments in the thread you shared all focus on journalistic standards and how the Podesta Release and coverage (two separate things but she mixes them up) don’t pass muster, when this person has fixed its ‘expert authority on WikiLeaks’ through successful disinformation, ie the false story she spread regarding WL and Turkish female voters.
[2016-10-14 12:11:48] <Emmy B> any attempt at rationality or scientific deduction seems abandoned?
[2016-10-14 12:31:03] <Emmy B> In a future Clinton administration the protagonists of the Podesta emails will likely hold positions of power. Their comments now regarding the leaks can become evidence of bias and vindictiveness, also can be used in any future prosecution. I hope someone keeps a tally, particularly of people that might be political appointments in the justice system, DOJ, and other depts. The more they talk the better.
[2016-10-15 07:25:57] <Emmy B> Greek The Press Project seems to have survived with generous donations and from Monday they start again. Pledge to continue their collaboration as media partners of WikiLeaks promising to ‘catch up’ what they have missed in relation to revelations whilst they were off air and also starting a co-operation with ‘The Intercept’, which is mostly unknown in Greece, specially mentioning to its revelations about the death of Tsakilidis (The Athens Affair – illegal interceptions by the NSA 2004/5 in Greece)
[2016-10-15 07:28:11] <Emmy B> Kostas Efimeros upbeat although sober, a lot of work still to be done to secure the future financially.

[2016-10-17 10:55:16] <Emmy B> My notifications going through the roof, hundreds and hundreds of RTs never before I have experienced this. I aquired over 200 followers in a single day, do others have the same experience? WikiLeaks is hot. Hoping all this awareness will help them/JA

[2016-10-17 12:42:21] <Emmy B> Time to re-visit JA’s speech of the 4th of October to the Berlin 10 Year Anniversary Event. There are clear references there on pressure on Ecuador.
[2016-10-17 12:43:28] <Emmy B> Can someone slightly better than me in video editing snip and circulate the particular point? or a time stamp might do for now.

[2016-10-18 12:01:23] <Emmy B> Like you’ve been doing Bean!!!! Well Done <3
[2016-10-18 12:41:16] <M> This Buzzfeed report is surprisingly good. It basically explains how Todd&Clare forged a UN document accusing JA and got suspended. It even refers to Eckersley as an “anti-Assange writer”. https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/the-bizarre-story-of-how-a-tiny-online-dating-site-accused-j?utm_term=.raLlNNNkQ#.lc60lllaX
[2016-10-18 12:45:32] <WISE Up Action> M: ha. Nice.
[2016-10-18 13:05:01] <M> The falling apart of Todd&Clare is fascinating and amusing. Currently their front page states that they are a “former United Nations Global Compact member” and links to their statement about JA. It’s beyond ridiculous!

[2016-10-18 14:27:03] <WISE Up Action> Anyone think this has MGT’s prints over it, or too complex for him? Some similarities to his old MOs?
[2016-10-18 14:28:36] <Emmy B> I could not say at this stage
[2016-10-18 14:29:19] <Emmy B> I have been thinking, since DNCLeaks how many disinfo plots did we have?

[2016-10-18 21:19:49] <M> Extraordinary. It’s really amusing to look through the Todd&Clare stuff and see how it’s so obviously fake e.g. their FB posts all received ~300 likes but nobody ever commented.

[2016-10-19 16:15:45] <Emmy B> reminds us pls?
[2016-10-19 16:16:19] <M> WL mentioned Alexa O’Brien had buddied up with him when we were discussing her anti-WL shift.
[2016-10-19 16:26:31] <Emmy B> Interesting! I think we are bund to hear more about this story. Since the pre-committment tweets imply Kerry/Ecuador/UK each country will have to spin their involvement before WL release, Ecuador came first, now US all we are waiting for is the UK, which will wisely wait to show its hand after the pre committment release.

[2016-10-21 08:40:46] <Emmy B> what on earth is going on?
[2016-10-21 09:54:11] <Emmy B> One has to factor in latest attempts to discredit WL through disinformation which I have mentioned before, could very well be coupled with psychological warfare tactics eg attempted break into Embassy, presence of armed ‘police’, vans driving round Hans Crescent over and over again, yes they have been noticed this week, as well as all kind of other stuff that a four year vigil presence can attest to that never reach the twittersphere.
[2016-10-21 09:59:58] <Emmy B> Many people are stopping outside the embassy in the short period that we are there tis week fretting about JA/WL with offers of help, urgent enquiries as to his health etc making us all worried and of course the main actors of this situation JA/WL & Ecuador could be part of the plan to force a desperate act ie attempt an exodus. This is not an ordinary. It is a siege and a war zone of a kind. Still, calmness must prevail and mental space for strategy always. I say it here as I say it to myself.
[2016-10-21 10:02:43] <Emmy B> sorry, I mean all of this psychological warfare “could be part of the plan to force a desperate act ie attempt an exodus…”

[2016-10-23 10:39:06] <M> Was it in response to something you tweeted at her? Or just randomly; when she blocked me it was out of the blue.
[2016-10-23 10:44:04] <Emmy B> Marie tweeted at her about a comment Alexa made and I replied to Marie with copy to her, I said something about at the end of a journey the best goodbye is ‘look after yourself’ something like this, she must have taken offence, so you are blocked too, well that’s it then.
[2016-10-23 10:46:46] <Emmy B> I am not sure with whom she is close to from the twitter community, I hope she has some good friend other than those around John Schindler, such a cruel bunch
[2016-10-23 11:58:29] <Emmy B> But I just took a look at her timeline and she took the trouble to write 26 tweets to educate @MaajidNawaz (LBC programme I mentioned above) in defence of Manning’s release that caused no harm, so thank goodness still firm in supporting Chelsea, which is great.

[2016-10-23 14:09:43] <WikiLeaks> New attack from Ball spreading. Not too bad. Suggest attacking on his bullshit rothschilds angle
[2016-10-23 14:14:52] <M> Such an opportunist.
[2016-10-23 14:29:51] <Emmy B> it is an opinion piece from start to finish, nothing new to say, it is an attack and he will be quoted but does his opinion carry weight? Useful to Clinton up to a point so unlikely to be quoted much in America, although he is being interviewed for a programme there, I think ‘The circus’? his although an ambitious article, it is a highly personal one, very subjective and obviously evidently so.
[2016-10-23 14:31:21] <Emmy B> For the UK it is different, many of the Media will love to re-produce and quote fro but he has not said anything that has not been said before.

[2016-10-23 15:13:39] <WikiLeaks> There’s new market demand. That it hasn’t been sead before does not mean it has been heard before in the market that will hear it now. He’ll use it to get TV slots. So it’s necessary to create doubt that he’s an accurate narrator.

[2016-10-25 15:03:45] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/m_cetera/status/791037053710569472 This is pretty hilarious. Notorious anti-WL troll Robert Caruso wrote “Henry Kissinger’s strategies in Laos and Chile are models of success that should be emulated, not criticized” in an article, but then had the paragraph deleted. And now he claims it was WikiLeaks who wrote the line!
[2016-10-26 07:19:07] <Emmy B> amazing!
[2016-10-26 07:20:13] <Emmy B> Rita Skeeter and her magic quill (Harry Potter)
[2016-10-26 07:21:50] <Emmy B> But here is one to take a look, an article best represent the attempts to defame, malign JA as a person as a means of weakening the WL work/publications. http://www.theestablishment.co/2016/10/25/are-progressives-being-played-by-wikileaks-and-julian-assange/
[2016-10-26 07:27:15] <Emmy B> Remember JA polemist Jessica Valenti has been mentioned in PodestaEmails and this one: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/18566https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/10/wikileaks-email-reveals-liberal-bloggers-coordinat.html
[2016-10-26 07:29:44] <Emmy B> In her twitter timeline I see a lot of criticism against her but hey ho the tide turned and many were I believe silenced by a tweet that she shared depicting a photo of threatening message. In her tweet she implies that recent misrepresented reports have given rise to hate and threats against her, the screenshot is indeed horrid. http://web.archive.org/web/20161025105453/https:/twitter.com/JessicaValenti/status/789821229117149184?lang=en-gb
[2016-10-26 07:37:12] <Emmy B> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/Quinnae_Moon/status/790992295764066307 Her tweet was re-tweeted over 800 times, a rare for her timeline and gained her much sympathy. She has returned, flags flying high, with a Guardian article on sexual assault (25th of October) https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/25/sexual-assault-tipping-point-elizabeth-warren-trump
[2016-10-26 07:39:27] <Emmy B> Katherine Cross has shared her article. (I will be sending down @ WL Task Force way this tweet later today). Why I mention it here is simply, due to unfortunately my experience with the trolls my attention was captured by the persona that has
[2016-10-26 07:42:05] <Emmy B> done the abusing. I think this is not a real person, it is a troll, so please careful how you respond to this issue as trolls are assisting Valenti in presenting herself as a victim and getting back on top of her game, sadly in my opinion, milking feminism for her pocket.
[2016-10-26 07:45:28] <Emmy B> I place some links here regarding this persona Daniel Barber who did the abusing, presenting ‘himself’ as a Bernie supporter, ‘he’ (better, this persona) has a long history of abusive comments.

[2016-10-26 08:11:47] <Emmy B> So to conclude, beware of the trolls on this one.
[2016-10-26 08:14:00] <Emmy B> I might be wrong but I think this persona has been successfully used to give Valenti a victim status which then leads to a wave of sympathy and support defending her ie the article Cross wrote both highlighting the abusive tweet and throwing the blame onto who else? JA and WL repeating all kinds of disinfo myths that lately have been thrown at WL/JA
[2016-10-26 08:17:37] <WISE Up Action> Very interesting, Em. Thanks for flagging this.
[2016-10-26 11:11:55] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/GlenCaplin1/status/791313662753595393 Giant rant by Clinton spokesperson.
[2016-10-26 16:24:52] <Emmy B> Malik Obama account tweeted by WL is not verified!!!
[2016-10-26 16:29:32] <M> Yes, but I think the consensus is that its accurate. The relationship between him and Obama isn’t exactly a good one, so it’s not surprising to see such a tweet from him.
[2016-10-26 16:31:18] <Emmy B> There is another account by him search the name
[2016-10-26 16:34:49] <Emmy B> Here @malikobama_
[2016-10-26 16:36:31] <Emmy B> WL tweeted from @ObamaMalik without verification it’s tricky
[2016-10-26 16:37:24] <Emmy B> There is so much disinfo currently We’re swimming in it.
[2016-10-26 16:45:07] <M> Right. I guess my point is, Malik Obama is not a person of power or influence, so a statement of support from him is not really that meaningful.
[2016-10-26 16:45:25] <M> So the idea that he would support WikiLeaks isn’t really groundbreaking or anything.

[2016-10-27 06:53:16] <WikiLeaks> the proof of life stuff seems absurd but is a very important and positve development

[2016-10-27 09:25:36] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/NRO/status/791528116862746624 There’s so many bizarre op-eds on the Podesta emails. Journos feel the need to reassure their readers that, even though the emails are newsworthy, WikiLeaks is a bad thing!
[2016-10-27 09:39:39] <Emmy B> I agree, considering #PodestaEmails speak eloquently of MSM’s collusion with Clinton establishment this is the result of ‘we have been found out’. Part of the political umbrella. But the threat is real for them as they are thinking journo’s e-mails might be next on the list as WL ‘does not hold anything as sacred’ remember JA’s Trafalgar speech 8.10.2011 ‘Journalists are war criminals’? perhaps some realise they might be next on the list as power actors. Sadly Greenwald/Wolf tet-a-tet discussion about privacy is both an expression of such fear and the development of an effective talking point. Suddenly WL threatens privacy. Perhaps end to end strong encryption advocates should provide the antithesis to such argument and demand such universal standard in online communications, a reference to Cypherpunks made by JA recently.

[2016-10-27 18:30:39] <WikiLeaks> She’s almost not saying anything, though, if you read closely. She’s just talking about RT and doesn’t get the RT contract.
[2016-10-27 19:17:30] <LibertarianLibrarian> Right now the American press has all gone just as insane as our political process. Wish I had time to be more proactive in aid to you all, but sadly I’ve been, to make a long story short, effectively laid off at work and I’m job hunting like crazy. But I’ll keep RT’ing y’all as much as I can and my heart is always with you.
[2016-10-27 19:24:59] <WikiLeaks> Sad to hear about your job. But change is good. An open horizon.
[2016-10-27 19:29:05] <LibertarianLibrarian> Thanks. And yes, I have some good interviews lined up. Just wanted to pop in and let everyone know I’m still with you. Besides, my entire nation has gone completely insane. Clinton or Trump in the White House? I am so embarrassed!

[2016-10-29 19:13:31] <WikiLeaks> Birgitta came to the embassy to make peace about six months ago. There’s no trust, one cannot trust a back-stabber, but there is an alignmet of interests.
[2016-10-29 19:16:28] <M> That’s good to hear.
[2016-10-29 20:31:21] <LibertarianLibrarian> I’m glad she made that effort also. It was a shame to see her swallowed by Hollywood-grandiosity before.
[2016-10-29 21:58:29] <Emmy B> Well she certainly does not lack courage and must have taken a lot to overcome her pride which is commendable, many challenges lie ahead.
[2016-10-29 21:59:03] <Emmy B> I agree Jenny!
[2016-10-30 06:43:16] <LibertarianLibrarian> You’re right also, Emmy. She has an opportunity here to do something amazing. And she’ll hardly be the first seduced by Hollywood glamour. Hopefully she’s learned from it.

[2016-11-02 23:48:46] <Emmy B> Well thank goodness this interview provides: 1. “proof of Life” 2. “He is still in the embassy” to dispel the tails of the latest disinfo crawling serpents. Very sober times, important to think post election and see how WL will retain the recent surge in support from the US
[2016-11-03 00:00:34] <WikiLeaks> Absolutely terrible that it is RT.
[2016-11-03 00:01:08] <WikiLeaks> It was for ITV. Management then killed it, so it was sold elsewhere.
[2016-11-03 00:12:37] <M> Ugh. So frustrating. Especially to hear that and then for RT to advertise it as their exclusive interview.
[2016-11-03 00:13:08] <M> They also say “RT’s John Pilger”??

[2016-11-03 14:29:47] <LibertarianLibrarian> What is amazing is that even people who are otherwise smart are so afraid of Trump, they think all the facts of Clinton’s corruption is bought by Trump. I detest Trump, but don’t believe for 1 second that Clinton isn’t utterly criminal.
[2016-11-03 14:30:11] <LibertarianLibrarian> Are bought… Bad grammar, sorry

[2016-11-03 15:26:00] <Emmy B> I saw it. There will be 1001 opinions on the matter if US/UK establishment was not pushing the it’s the Russians/Martians line.
[2016-11-03 15:32:57] <LibertarianLibrarian> LOL Emmy! But very true. Ironic how things come around again. The Russians are coming! The Russians are coming. *sigh*

[2016-11-04 13:37:00] <WISE Up Action> Oh Christ
[2016-11-04 14:27:17] <M> I don’t understand the push of all the satanic rutual articles. The email is a weird invitation, but the articles go on to assume he took part in it etc etc.
[2016-11-04 14:28:22] <Emmy B> which one?
[2016-11-04 14:29:10] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/LifeZette/status/794638355178934272 This and similar previous ones.
[2016-11-04 14:29:42] <M> Especially with such a misleading headline.
[2016-11-04 14:34:23] <LibertarianLibrarian> That whole thing is totally bizarre. Then again, anything the Clinton’s and their cronies are into wouldn’t surprise me too much.
[2016-11-04 14:37:27] <Emmy B> If writers of articles are Trump supporters it makes sense to put a lot more in the story to put off Christian voters against Podesta. There is real deep fear for satan/occult practices (I am given talismans every time I go to Greece for perceived protection of me and the kids from the evil eye/satan and all sorts) among Christians as this is a major pre-occupation of organised religion.
[2016-11-04 14:48:36] <Emmy B> let’s not forget the origin of the term ‘witch hunt’
[2016-11-04 14:50:52] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/snopes/status/794657572754247684
[2016-11-04 14:50:58] <Emmy B> when I say the fear is real, I will also put some context, early Christians were accused of drinking blood and practising cannibalism etc (holy communion misunderstood)
[2016-11-04 14:52:40] <Emmy B> it is a can of worms as well as the stuff of comic strips
[2016-11-04 14:53:19] <M> Right. The term comes from persecuting people based on ridiculous notions. So the hypothesis that Podesta participated in Satanic rituals should not be pushed because it distracts from his actual corrupt practices.
[2016-11-04 14:58:50] <Emmy B> I am not saying that Podesta did anything like that. Still, the fear is real among Christian communities since, let’s face it, organised religion has a lot of rituals that are controlled by priests but if they are performed by lay people, it is taboo, shocking. I am not familiar with the artist in question but the theme plays to the darkest fears and instincts of people.
[2016-11-04 14:59:52] <LibertarianLibrarian> It’s certainly not as important as the obvious corruption, but it symbolic of the attitude of these people who think they can do anything and get away with it. In that sense, only, it’s worth noting.
[2016-11-04 15:10:25] <Emmy B> PS in Greece, very much dominated by a Christian culture there are often scandals about satanists or occult practices, and people tremble. There is belief in the ‘evil eye’, reading the future in coffee cups, and sometimes one wonders where religion ends and magic begins as it gets blurry. 🙂 but in a set beliefs which accepts miracles and supernatural power like Christian communities do, there is also a recognition that evil powers exist represented by Satan, at a mild modern context the yin and yang but for organised church as well as people who believe, this is real. In our modern world we demand rationality above all in public office rather any sort of mumbo-jumbo although let’s not forget her ‘majesty the queen’ is also head of the church of England :-p for Podesta this story is bad news.
[2016-11-04 15:14:00] <M> Another of the emails confirms that John Podesta didn’t go https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/25325
[2016-11-04 15:19:34] <Emmy B> true, but ‘Marina missed you’ implies familiarity ie they might know each other quite well. (the truth is if one wants to interpret the matter in a certain way they will)
[2016-11-04 15:22:01] <M> More here. It’s just a stupid lead to chase. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/04/no-john-podesta-didnt-drink-bodily-fluids-at-a-secret-satanist-dinner/?tid=sm_tw
[2016-11-04 15:23:07] <Emmy B> The worst things will be if he is forced to make a statement on the matter, then whatever he says will feed into the circle of gossip, it is the taboo aspect of the matter which is simply toxic. He may be dropped from the dinner list of many a Christian believe me, quietly.
[2016-11-04 15:34:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> Can’t say I feel sorry for him.
[2016-11-04 15:43:57] <WISE Up Action> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/794642764713562113
[2016-11-04 15:48:49] <WikiLeaks> “Marina missed you” and “at the appartment” implies something rather close.
[2016-11-04 15:50:06] <WikiLeaks> A lot of US east coast elite play with esotericism as a status signal to other elites. Like having a psychiatrist was a status signal.
[2016-11-04 15:50:40] <WikiLeaks> He UFOism may be that project or is perhaps being done for electoral reasons.
[2016-11-04 15:53:18] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/LifeZette/status/794638355178934272 But why not say that instead of promoting misleading & false stories like this?

[2016-11-04 15:55:48] <WikiLeaks> Lobster risotto?
[2016-11-04 16:17:30] <M> How about: “Podesta sacrificed his lobster risotto to Satan — and you can, too!” That’s a headline everyone can enjoy.
[2016-11-04 16:22:25] <LibertarianLibrarian> LOL
[2016-11-04 16:27:06] <WikiLeaks> Haha.
[2016-11-04 16:27:34] <WikiLeaks> That manning statement in NYT is very concerning.
[2016-11-04 16:28:02] <WikiLeaks> He’s shown no evidence of fabulism before.
[2016-11-04 16:28:40] <M> Yes it was really bizarre.
[2016-11-04 16:30:26] <M> With the solitary confinement and multiple suicide attempts, her mental state is very worrying. I hope we hear a visit report from the attorneys soon.
[2016-11-04 16:31:55] <LibertarianLibrarian> I agree. Her treatment has been horrific.
[2016-11-05 01:49:44] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/RT_com/status/794819218080464896 Interview is quite good.
[2016-11-05 08:22:07] <LibertarianLibrarian> Just had a friend ask me why WL isn’t releasing anything on Trump. Had to explain, again, they can only release what they receive. Hope I got through this time.
[2016-11-05 08:23:02] <LibertarianLibrarian> Some think that it’s all bought by Trump. Drives me nuts.

[2016-11-09 04:14:49] <LibertarianLibrarian> Glad I ended up sleeping through last night. Insanity. I don’t like Trump but I do understand the vote. I suspect it parallels the Brexit – people showing how angry they are with the status quo. Going to be crazy for a while, but don’t expect Trump to be anything but manages by the establishment.
[2016-11-09 04:14:59] <LibertarianLibrarian> *managed
[2016-11-09 04:18:38] <Emmy B> very true Jenny!
[2016-11-09 04:29:43] <Bean> yes all of these challenges for the establishment are absorbed & manipulated to suit, but process is chaotic and so more cracks appear + establishment must embrace more overtly repressive tactics in that process – complete with xenophobia and all that other fun stuff (due to where the challenges are coming from) – also not necessarily in their interests re maintaining power and their global economy
[2016-11-09 04:30:13] <Bean> ‘fun’ times
[2016-11-09 04:33:25] <WISE Up Action> Media likes to simplify but similar to Brexit, different communities have different motivations and it’s complicated. Again though yes frustration gets a vehicle and from people off the radar of political establishment and media bubble. Trump will be boxed in, he’ll have to be. Interesting how that will play out. Remember his poor relations with GOP elite now.
[2016-11-09 04:59:13] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, he’ll have a fight with all of Congress to get anything done. It’ll deadlock him. But I hope it trickles into some minds that this is sheer frustration and anger against the govt establishment and that is the lesson that should be learned and answered.
[2016-11-09 05:12:54] <WISE Up Action> Feel Brexit always led by a power struggle between existing (Tory) elites with Farage gleefully intervening in Ordinary Bloke guise. Though Trump playing that character, absence of rival elite with GOP folding so quickly? Just my take..
[2016-11-09 05:15:26] <LibertarianLibrarian> The GOP has been falling apart for a while. This isn’t a win for them, it’s just showing the Dems are in just as bad shape. There will party shakeups. That will be the interesting part.

[2016-11-09 09:15:36] <WISE Up Action> WL: a general rant at Dems becoming the Establishment party, ignoring disaffected citizens and poor tactics re dealing with Trump. TYT saying they will be going after Dem party full on for the above.
[2016-11-09 09:16:49] <LibertarianLibrarian> Good. Both parties need to learn some lessons.

[2016-11-10 19:35:56] <M> It’s ok. The editing is choppy.
[2016-11-10 19:53:09] <WikiLeaks> tweetable or not? does he say stupid stuff?
[2016-11-10 20:18:00] <M> Probably not. I don’t think it’s him, I think it’s the editing.
[2016-11-10 20:18:48] <M> There’s one part where he says “WL has never until now failed in this vetting process.” But there’s literally points where they are editing in the middle of sentences.
[2016-11-10 22:15:53] <Emmy B> Juan Branco interview is good, CNN throws everything at him, he responds very well, also, his genuine answers are winning. Yes editing is very obvious in chopping answers. I note that interviewer addresses JB as if he was WL rather than on the legal defence team

[2016-11-12 11:57:26] <M> I will check stores, but doubtful they are still out since it’s been 2-3 days since the recall.
[2016-11-12 14:02:39] <Emmy B> I know it is slightly off-topic here but Obama is to visit Athens this week possibly Monday the 14th. I read about what he will speak about, eg Turkey. The latter is very unstable, several politicians currently in gov and outside have been making bold declarations against Greek sovereignty derived by the 1923 Lausanne Treaty. Albania under Turkish influence has ripped up the naval border agreement with Greece and FYROMacedonia continues to propagate land claims over Greece in its constitution. US foreign policy has sadly favoured all adversaries of Greece. With Greece practically bankrupt, Troika still in control and Nato patrolling the Aegean for refugees, the situation is not ideal. That Obama chooses to visit is very curious to me. Their influence over IMF and Merkel regarding the debt and its forgiveness (not real forgiveness but a vehicle to manage it to allow some growth) is said to be Obama’s ‘gift’ A lot will be said about the visit, (he will also visit the island of Lesbos) this week, it is an opportunity to tweet WL’s most recent release about Greece and Cables full of the various national security problems described in them including Cyprus.
[2016-11-12 14:18:21] <Emmy B> The week is not the best for a US presidential visit, on the 17th of November, a national day dedicated to the struggle for democracy when students, workers and others rose up in rebellion in 1973 to oppose the CIA backed junta and were brutally killed. 17 years ago Clinton visited Greece and half apologised for the US role in supporting the junta. Again there are plenty of WL Cables on the subject. These may be the issues in the news regarding his visit.

[2016-11-21 07:25:54] <WikiLeaks> there is a .press
[2016-11-21 07:27:00] <WikiLeaks> Why did he ask a dumb question about ‘police guard’?
[2016-11-21 08:41:40] <Emmy B> he is new in politics and first time member of london assembly in last May’s elections so he has never received my previous letters on the issue. I will be writing back this time directly to him (previously I wrote a general letter to all assembly members) with an opportunity to inform him better on the particular issues. He says he may ask a further question to the Mayor, so I better start thinking of suggestions, any ideas would be most welcome. Thanks.
[2016-11-21 08:58:12] <WikiLeaks> All question sasked by them in the last six months about JA have been useless because they were no worded carefully enough.
[2016-11-21 08:58:37] <WikiLeaks> [other than demonstrating that people are bothered to ask questions which is not nothing]

[2016-11-21 09:22:46] <WISE Up Action> Didn’t realise someone had actually been arrested for this.
[2016-11-21 09:32:39] <Emmy B> @ wiseup it is the first time this information comes into the public sphere.
[2016-11-21 09:37:54] <Emmy B> @ wl, perhaps there is a chance now
[2016-11-21 09:40:21] <Emmy B> what kind of question would be useful?
[2016-11-21 10:02:50] <WikiLeaks> Give some suggestions
[2016-11-21 10:15:15] <Emmy B> Any questions have to be relevant to the responsibilities of the Mayor and the controlling function of the London Assembly otherwise they will not be within its remit to question and expect an answer.
[2016-11-21 10:18:30] <Emmy B> Mr Kurten suggests: “I may ask a further question asking what the Met is doing to ensure the safety and wellbeing of Mr. Assange and the other residents of the Embassy given the recent incident.
I hope that these answers from the Mayor are useful. Do let me know if there are any further questions you would like me to put to the Mayor about Mr. Assange and his situation, although I believe that ultimately it is only central government in Westminster which can lift the threats against him.”
[2016-11-21 10:21:54] <Emmy B> Perhaps the question should fine-tune ‘wellbeing’ to include a question regarding access to appropriate medical care defined by JA’s published medical records?
[2016-11-21 10:26:33] <Emmy B> A different direction of questioning perhaps could include Mayor’s and Commissioner’s responsibilities for the safety and wellbeing of JA and Embassy people particularly in view of UNWGAD (Sadiq Khan has been a human rights lawyer) and as the most surveilled embassy in the world.
[2016-11-21 10:27:30] <Emmy B> of course any recommendations on my part may not be taken up by Mr Kurten but I can certainly try.
[2016-11-21 12:09:58] <WikiLeaks> No, it’s not helpful. All that will do is increase surveillance.
[2016-11-21 12:10:21] <WikiLeaks> The questions should be arround refusal to reveal the spend
[2016-11-21 12:10:27] <WikiLeaks> or about the robot cameras etc
[2016-11-21 12:10:45] <WikiLeaks> or about why it was legit to spend that much $ in the first place if it wasn’t in the second
[2016-11-21 12:10:53] <WikiLeaks> or about have they request sweden pay
[2016-11-21 12:11:02] <WikiLeaks> requested that sweden pay and if not, why not
[2016-11-21 12:11:46] <WikiLeaks> in the swedish supreme court response by the swedish prosecution they state that the UK has never asked them to pay hence they do not have to factor in the expense into the proportionality of what they are doing
[2016-11-21 12:12:31] <WikiLeaks> doubt it is the most surveilled embassy in the world
[2016-11-21 12:12:47] <WikiLeaks> US embassy in moscow for example likely has greater
[2016-11-21 12:19:52] <Emmy B> ok, thank you very much this is a good direction, I will go towards that end and let’s see what we get.
[2016-11-21 12:25:01] <WikiLeaks> The second point is probably good. The also avoid FOIA on the budget citing national security reasons
[2016-11-21 12:25:10] <WikiLeaks> they
[2016-11-21 12:30:13] <Emmy B> sorry by second point do you mean my second point “Mayor’s and Commissioner’s responsibilities for the safety and wellbeing of JA and Embassy people particularly in view of UNWGAD” or your second point “about the robot cameras etc”
[2016-11-22 02:30:26] <WikiLeaks> asking swe for costs and sw saying in their court doc that since uk never asked for costs they are not factoring them into whether to keep the thing going or not
[2016-11-22 03:47:21] <Emmy B> All good advise thank you <3
[2016-11-22 22:52:58] <Emmy B> oh well trolls galore at my timeline at the mo and a website just launched http://whereisassange.org/

[2016-11-23 13:37:20] <Emmy B> should I start adding them to the troll list or is it a waste of time?
[2016-11-23 13:38:41] <WikiLeaks Task Force> waste of time imo. some of them are real supporters who believe information they have been fed. (others are real trolls, but you’d risk putting several supporters on that list)
[2016-11-23 13:39:09] <WISE Up Action> I’m just ignoring.
[2016-11-23 13:40:20] <Emmy B> yes and it would take hours of work to identify who is who, I have started blocking
[2016-11-23 13:42:56] <Emmy B> we got the same stories at the vigil by one young guy calling himself Alex who said JA had been smuggled to US the day there was a chemical leak at City airport (which was apparently a smokescreen so he could be smuggled out) – why can’t I be rude every once in a while?

( I was not aware he had asked this question 19 October 2016)
[2016-11-23 14:06:31] <Emmy B> I would like to see London Mayor Mr Khan, a human rights lawyer, no less, say otherwise if he dares…
[2016-11-24 17:39:20] <M> Online polls are a pretty silly thing. Modi has suddenly leapt SO far in the lead in the TIME poll – there must be a concerted effort to get him to win.
[2016-11-24 17:40:14] <WikiLeaks> Something is not right with that tme poll.
[2016-11-24 17:40:31] <WikiLeaks> JA was at 14%
[2016-11-24 17:41:03] <WikiLeaks> But more seriously, if you go through the poll subjects you can see how many people voted yes/no for them.
[2016-11-24 17:41:21] <WikiLeaks> 65% voted yes for JA
[2016-11-24 17:41:33] <WikiLeaks> But half that for modi.
[2016-11-24 17:43:28] <LibertarianLibrarian> That kind of poll is probably very easy to manipulate, either by Time or by external people wanting to force a certain result.
[2016-11-24 17:44:03] <M> Well it’s weird too because you don’t have to go through the whole poll for your vote to count, but you do have to do it in order.
[2016-11-24 17:44:37] <M> So people can just vote yes on JA and nothing else. But if you want to vote yes on Modi you have to vote on 20 others to get there.
[2016-11-24 17:50:58] <M> Account based polls may have some worth, but anything that’s 100% open doesn’t offer any useful results or data. Except maybe who can round up the biggest online army.
[2016-11-24 17:54:14] <LibertarianLibrarian> True, and they’re vulnerable to any nut with computer skills and too much time on their hands.
[2016-11-24 18:05:56] <WikiLeaks> Are you sure you don’t have to go through the whole poll for your vote to count?
[2016-11-24 18:07:15] <WikiLeaks> There is also their “Face to Face” poll which has toaly unclear weighting.
[2016-11-24 18:07:33] <M> No not certain. It just seems that way since it shows the results after each vote.
[2016-11-24 18:07:44] <WikiLeaks> Yes. It’s a meassure of who can collect the most people/high quality bots. But that is a measure of something important.

Assange overlooked again. http://time.com/4589502/person-of-the-year-2016-shortlist/
[2016-12-06 03:12:26] <Emmy B> [Card-summary] https://greekemmy.com/2016/12/05/ecuadorian-embassy-intruder-arrested/ I have published in my blog the Mayor’s answer regarding the arrest of the Embassy Intruder here:
[2016-12-06 03:15:38] <Emmy B> In the same post I have published a new question by David Kurten and an answer by the Mayor: Question: “Given the recent attempted break-in to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, how is the Metropolitan Police going to ensure the continued safety of Mr. Assange, who some would argue is effectively a political prisoner under house arrest? “Answer by the Mayor “
The Police are obliged to execute the European Arrest Warrant for Mr Assange and will do so should he choose to leave the Ecuadorean embassy.
Regarding the attempted break-in at the Embassy, I am assured that the MPS continually assess the security arrangements of all diplomatic premises in London. Clearly, it would not be appropriate to detail these publicly.”
[2016-12-06 03:16:40] <Emmy B> I note that the Mayors reply focuses on the EAW and not on ‘he broke his bail’ mantra.
[2016-12-06 03:20:38] <Emmy B> Further to recent correspondence I have had with Mr Kurten, he writes that he shares my concerns about the welfare of Mr Assange and he has tabled this week a further question to the Mayor and I quote: “asking if he will seek to recover the operating costs from the Swedish government, considering that he has just invoiced Volkswagen for costs relating to the Congestion Charge due to the emissions scandal”, I will monitor the website for any updates on the matter.
[2016-12-06 10:15:06] <Emmy B> The next Question to the Mayor session will be on Wed 14th of December but it could very well be that an answer will not be forthcoming till much later, in a written format in the new year.
[2016-12-06 16:14:45] <WikiLeaks> Ace question there from Mr. Kurten. Good job.

QUESTION: On Turkey. Mark, did you see these reports that the son-in-law of President Erdogan has ties with ISIS operations smuggling oil into Turkey? MR TONER: Yeah, I mean look, we’ve – first of all, WikiLeaks – we don’t touch WikiLeaks, we don’t touch the — QUESTION: Besides from WikiLeaks — MR TONER: No, but aside from that — QUESTION: Aside from WikiLeaks — MR TONER: — these are allegations we’ve heard before. QUESTION: Yeah. MR TONER: We’ve been very strenuous in saying that while we cannot rule out any illegal smuggling of oil – ISIL-refined or ISIL – ISIL-owned oil across the border from Turkey, because those routes – smuggling routes have been in existence, as we’ve said before, for centuries. Turkey has taken steps to seal up, close off its borders with Syria and that’s had an effect on this trade. But we’ve seen nothing to lead us to believe that there’s any kind of government involvement in this Trade).

[2017-01-04 13:43:17] <LibertarianLibrarian> Whether it was a horribly mistaken or not, the election clearly showed how angry the average American is with the Washington power structure. Even if Trump’s a narcissistic moron, I was still relieved to see Clinton go down. And greetings from the geographical center of the US. My first full day in Kansas City.
[2017-01-04 13:47:05] <Emmy B> Lovely to see you are back Jenny <3
[2017-01-04 13:48:00] <Emmy B> Do you think we should start a petition to Trump to pardon Chelsea Manning? The world is topsy turvy, could he do it?
[2017-01-04 14:02:01] <LibertarianLibrarian> Trump could do it. He basically is focused on his own celebrity. Appeal to that. But I suspect that like Obama, he’ll be controlled.
[2017-01-04 14:13:19] <Emmy B> A good point there! I keep thinking of the gravy train with US/UK arming Saudia Arabia how many orders are in the pipeline… billions, and how his re-approachment with Russia is undermining decades worth of US/UK policy propping up islamists and others to counteract Russia, The British Empire followed the same policy before the Soviet Era. How on earth Trump is going to be allowed to go forward with a change in foreign policy?A recent Greek PM Karamanlis who tried to re-approach with Russia (without compromising Greece’s commitment to Nato) and the Pythia op planned his assassination by US interests, he resigned before the end of his term triggering an election. How far would such interests go to protect the existing foreign policy?
[2017-01-04 14:32:20] <LibertarianLibrarian> Good question, Emmy. I think he may make China and the Islamics (whatever they’re called lately) into the bad guys. I’m delighted to see Clinton’s anti-Russia agitating didn’t get further, but I’m worried a bit re China. Trump will have to be careful there. But I can see Trump and Putin siding together more in regards to the Middle East. Not sure if that will be a disaster or a success, probably a mix, but I’m sick of this resurgent McCarthyism recently. Bad, bad, bad idea. Trump’s a wild card. I think that’s why I wasn’t surprised he won and not upset either. He’s a sexist narcissist but that’s not new in political leaders.

[2017-01-07 16:06:01] <LibertarianLibrarian> It’s really bizarre how Americans have been led to believe simultaneously that Julian is under Putin’s thumb and that he’s gone ‘right wing’, both of which are clearly absurd and contradictory with each other (as most Americans still associate Russia with communism to some degree). Sarah Palin (this no endorsement of her) was ridiculed for saying the Russians are coming… Yet now it’s Clinton saying the same thing and suddenly it’s not ridiculous? I don’t get people sometimes. Believe it or not, there actually is something between your ears. Try using for it a change. Argh! Then again, Senator Schumer may actually NOT have any thing between his ears.
[2017-01-07 16:12:39] <Emmy B> hahaha
[2017-01-07 16:12:44] <Emmy B> <3
[2017-01-07 16:13:24] <Emmy B> very good points there Jenny!
[2017-01-07 16:18:59] <LibertarianLibrarian> Thanks. Just letting off steam. The whole Putin is the bad guy thing is absurd and out of hand. And why can’t people get the simple concept that WL can only release what it’s been given, can’t magically make up stuff on Trump. And source is irrelevant, all the stuff on Clinton and DNC is TRUE however bad Trump may or may not be. Like Duh!!! When otherwise intelligent people repeat this stuff… *steam comes out of my ears*
[2017-01-07 16:35:04] <Emmy B> The thing is why didn’t the pro-Clinton media found good stuff for Clinton in the Podesta e-mails? it was her campaign manager after all, if they found nothing good about her in there well he was at least a lousy campaign manager, I have not heard one bad word written about him, complete denial of any responsibility. Yet they let their country go through this turmoil of ‘Russia phobia’ as if they are some kind of banana republic. How will the rest of the world see the US intelligence services playing the role that they do and Obama encouraging the ‘I am shaking in my boots because of little Russia’ the elephant scared of the mouse kind of thing, US has 900 military bases around the world is this the way to behave for internal consumption and to protect the gravy train deals with Saudi and the rest of ME tyrants? Is it worth it? I mean , is this the American Dream? The CIA, Clinton and friends are damaging the Brand US but perhaps it is not a bad thing…who knows, so much dust we just have to wait till it settles.
[2017-01-07 16:39:38] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, good point re Podesta. I have no clue what will happen Trump is a wild card which may actually be a good thing, at the least we can watch the Washington power brokers running around after him which will be highly amusing (if they don-t gag him or worse first).
[2017-01-07 16:46:12] <Emmy B> He has not held a single political office, what allies may he have in Washington, I don’t know, the Republicans may be in the end the ones to control him, having Congress and Senate and President a lot can be done, but with such ‘secure’ environment for passing law, a weak opposition, perhaps we will see fractions within the Republicans playing both government and opposition. When was the last time that all three Con/Sen/Pre belong to the same party, and when are there elections for Congress again?
[2017-01-07 16:55:45] <LibertarianLibrarian> Hmm, not sure last time all 3 in same party, though a lot of Republicans are anti-Trump. So who knows? Congressional terms are 2 years. I think they are staggered so some up every year. Senators are 4 years, and I think staggered as well. Some should be up in 2017, and definitely in 2018, etc. I’m pretty sure.
[2017-01-07 17:00:58] <Emmy B> Well if the Democrats get their act together they might stand a chance, but some fresh air will be badly needed they missed their chance with Sanders to bring in some new ideas and re-allignment with what the times require to mobile voters, how long will they be involved in this self-defeating policy of the ‘burnt land’ since they lost. Alternatively, it might give an opportunity to other parties to move in fill the vacuum.
[2017-01-07 17:06:49] <Emmy B> goodnight from me! 🙂

[2017-01-17 15:14:07] <WISE Up Action> Hope this gives Julian heart. Let’s all think this through and get him out.
[2017-01-17 15:27:11] <LibertarianLibrarian> Great news. And yes, let us all hope this gives Julian strength.

[2017-01-22 15:14:11] <WISE Up Action> All, just to advise to be wary of the PardonManning account. Seems to have changed hands recently and started anti-WL messaging. Already clashing with Emmy and other good people. May be worth watching.

[2017-01-25 06:22:27] <LibertarianLibrarian> Amazing how people find it so easy to follow smear campaigns that anyone with the Internet could check for veracity (or in this case, fabrications).
[2017-01-25 13:51:57] <Emmy B> What is happening in the US post Trump Jenny?
[2017-01-25 14:15:13] <LibertarianLibrarian> A lot of whining, mostly. There were some women’s marches and protests. In the hospital where I work, everyone is waiting to see what happens with Obamacare and no one knows yet. A lot of ‘he’s crazy, who did this, what’s going to happen’-type stuff. I’m in the let’s just relax, wait and see contingent. Glad he did dump the TTP, not so happy if he does anti-Muslim stuff. But basically, most Presidents end up tied by Washington bureaucracy, same old stuff.

[2017-01-26 08:19:15] <LibertarianLibrarian> Not surprising. Trump’s a reality TV person and they always try to be as outrageous as possible. Be more surprised if he settled down his verbiage any time soon.

[2017-02-19 04:19:28] <WikiLeaks> Stupid groupism.
[2017-02-19 04:19:56] <WikiLeaks> Lauri will have to deal with Trump’s DoJ
[2017-02-19 04:20:24] <WikiLeaks> So Ekeland is playing to his peers and not to the interests of his clients.
[2017-02-19 04:42:12] <Emmy B> Yes is of concern
[2017-02-19 04:43:19] <Emmy B> We stayed for 45 min outside the TUC but had to move on as we were causing quite a stir apparently.
[2017-02-19 04:45:48] <Emmy B> Really good conversation with some ppl but several opposition to correa ppl complained so organisers asked us to move. Originally we had approached organisers and they had agreed we could stay but changed their position under pressure.
[2017-02-19 04:46:52] <Emmy B> Anyway we did really good work flyering whilst we were there 🙂

[2017-02-28 14:23:11] <WISE Up Action> Satter beavers away to make nothing out of nothing. Though irritating, he gets minimal response mostly.
[2017-02-28 14:27:04] <Emmy B> Still, he builds himself to be an expert an ‘authority’ to strengthen his future pen
[2017-02-28 14:41:39] <WISE Up Action> He’s spun it out to 7 tweets so far. Usual innuendo and nudge-nudge style.

[2017-03-07 22:27:30] <Emmy B> So if I want to search the Vault7 for stuff about Greece how do I do it? There is no search engine yet.
[2017-03-07 22:37:49] <WikiLeaks> can be accesed by the WL advanced search
[2017-03-07 22:38:48] <Emmy B> Thank you! 🙂
[2017-03-07 22:42:00] <Emmy B> Vault7 is not listed on the filter on the left of the screen so users would not know it was there. I narrowed search by date of release and had a Vault7 result.
[2017-03-08 11:50:30] <Emmy B> Regarding the WIkiLeaks poll about collaborating with tech companies, I voted yes as it is in the public interest, WikiLeaks though should attempt to protect themselves as collaborating with tech companies can open up critisism of favouritism or/and ‘aiding the enemy’ since the USG definition of ‘enemy’ is so ad hoc (see Mannings trial). I think it is of use to ask that tech firms form consortium with committment to share fixes on an open bases and not to use this for competitive advantage over others in this way there is true public benefit. As long as the Grand Jury is ongoing How can WL share these ‘CIA cyber guns’ with the ‘CIA Targets’ – the tech companies- Only when the Grand Jury is disbanded and tech world stands up for WL can sharing the tools be perhaps safe for WL, in any case is good to find out what people think.

[2017-03-11 03:10:56] <Emmy B> oh dear dear!
[2017-03-11 03:13:56] <WikiLeaks> Despite EFF formally being his lawyers. Disgraceful.
[2017-03-11 03:16:15] <Emmy B> I did not know this about Jacob’s lawyers. The thing is perhaps she does not realise but at the Democracy Now interview (a broadcaster with obvious affinity and sympathy towards WikiLeaks), to the average viewer she comes across as ‘covering up’ for the CIA. In comparison, speaking to AP (generally hostile to WL) she is more willing to contribute to the debate and clear she views aspects of the release as positive and in line with EFF’s consumer privacy objectives if nothing else.
[2017-03-11 03:19:20] <Emmy B> We are ‘political animals’, she is acting ‘politically’ but perhaps, to my mind, compromising her function at the EFF due to her affiliations or personal bias. As Vault7 release progresses she is obviously going to be ‘the person to go to’ for commentary in media, we shall see her stance how it develops over time.
[2017-03-11 03:28:37] <Emmy B> Congratulations btw 🙂 who would have thought an organisation so powerful, dark unaccountable, having performed many evil deeds will finally get some light thrown at it. It is also interesting to see the positions taken by commentaries, do they see the face of CIA/DorianGray or its portrait momentarily revealed by WL.

Also sick to hear she was part of persecuting Jake. I’ve always been a strong EFF advocate and they usually do good work. Hate that kind of politics-playing.
[2017-03-11 09:57:54] <Emmy B> What is happening over in America at the moment Jenny?
[2017-03-11 10:14:05] <LibertarianLibrarian> Life goes on. There’s a lot of utter disgust with Trump, Washington, etc. I suspect most people just expect to get screwed over by govt. I think most people are against that stupid Mexican wall thing. Women’s groups are generally up in arms re Trump, I’m still wondering why they weren’t the same re Bill Clinton. The fight over the pipeline still ongoing. No one has a clue what’s going to happen re Obamacare. And generally we all knew we were spied on anyway and no one ever liked the CIA, so I suspect the average person’s response is ‘so what’s new?’ Sad, but I had kinds thought the same thing.
[2017-03-11 10:18:01] <LibertarianLibrarian> I don’t watch network news or read NYT, rarely WaPo, because they’re hired shills for whoever is paying them the most. Rely more on Twitter independents and RT and Democracy Now, but lately buried in work and learning Kansas City.
[2017-03-11 10:19:23] <LibertarianLibrarian> Actually – sorry for rambling – all can be said in one word re American attitudes: Disgust.

They are one of the big vendors in the library world. Not quite as horrible as the giant publishers like Elsevier but still big and costly. Nice giveaways at conferences, though. LOL

[2017-03-16 15:19:08] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yeah. My cousin briefly worked in the mail room of the White House under Clinton so he thinks the Clintons walk on water. He is functioning enough to do basic jobs and take public transport, but impressionable and developmentally delayed. Hate to see anyone like that misused.

[2017-03-16 15:32:02] <LibertarianLibrarian> Can I just say that while I knew Trump was a lunatic, the latest stuff I heard is an absolute farce. Apparently his people are discussing trying to force people on Medicaid to work… but the primary reason for getting Medicaid is because you can NOT work – it goes to the handicapped and children.

[2017-03-17 07:08:12] <LibertarianLibrarian> That’s insane! I’m a strong anti-govt-involvement advocate but there are reasons why we have to have the necessary evil, and taking care of children and the disabled is on that list. It’s sick how much power the military and its parasitic industries have. We could solve so many problems if we just cut our military spending by even a fifth. Argh!

[2017-03-24 01:00:08] <WISE Up Action> Which Emmy has already seen, I notice 🙂
[2017-03-24 01:43:07] <Emmy B> Yes thanks wise up!Bizarreness, Kevin Gallagher retweeted this and after I posted a comment on the twitter thread I got a tweet from Isis Agora Lovecroft (is it me or does the name aspire to emulate British aristocratic onomatopoeia) which she then deleted, something like ‘I had to do something to stop him because of his behaviour’ – I blocked her not wanting to be anywhere near such individual, anyway does anyone know this lady’s real name?
[2017-03-24 01:45:20] <Emmy B> And it is perhaps the amazing world of the ethers which leaves so much room for the imagination that some eventually lose touch with reality.
[2017-03-24 07:30:34] <Emmy B> [Card-player] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpJvHxmYAXo @ wikileaks no doubt the interference with the press conference yesterday had a qualitative effect on it. Even the audio recordings circulating in you tube without the pauses are of doubly poor quality since by removing the pauses caused by the interference the audio has the appearance of a normal essay type monologue but of course if you are trying to pay attention and understand what is being said the interruptions are evident, although by first appearance not so easily detected due to the JA’s naturally steady tone of speech. For someone who perhaps may not have been aware with the interference and interruptions during the live transmission and hears the audio recording for example here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpJvHxmYAXo
[2017-03-24 07:51:49] <WikiLeaks> It’s a war. They hacked the three press conference systems last tuesday.
[2017-03-24 08:14:18] <Emmy B> I see! it is the hardest of conditions still it did take place which was great, despite the problems. Old fashion technology as back up for the after event dissemination of information is important as journo’s reporting on this would want easy to copy quotes from JA. This release will be revisited for many months to come, and as the different parts of the release go ahead interest will fluctuate but progressively increase, so plan B (old fashion technology for a back up recording of the press conference not a bad idea) JA is right that tech co’s and tech journals/journalists reporting on the matter tend to ignore the political aspect of the issue, and so the analysis provided by WL during the press conference, bringing everything together (technical, political, geopolitical, legal) it is of great value in sparking discussions. Also, perhaps consider, at a time when the release is a bit further down, a round table discussion post publication with small number of ppl reviewing the releases so far, not live (no avoid interference), pre-recorded but with the possibility of going over the material and reviewing its impact (Brexit Club style but only 30-60 min long) of course it is easy for me to say… anyways we continue to be amazed at WL efforts to prevail no matter what so keep it up <3

[2017-03-28 04:00:27] <Emmy B> It seems so. Still extraordinary amount of time. Plus the Swedish Ministry of Justice could have hanged on to the report for weeks before passing it on to the Swedish Prosecution Service.
[2017-03-28 04:05:30] <Emmy B> What I find misleading is the expression ‘the report from Ecuador’ as it can be misconstrued to mean the report that was received directly from Ecuador on the 4th of January, rather than what the Swedish Prosecution Service actually means as ‘Report from Ecuador’ ie the Report prepared by the Ecuadorian Prosecution/Justice Ministry about the Interview with Mr Assange conducted 14/15 Nov 2016, which was passed on to the Swedish Ministry under MLA and which the Swedish Ministry passed on to the Swedish Prosecution Service on the 4th of January 2017 after it was received by them at some unspecified time during Nov/Dec 2016.

[2017-04-13 15:06:09] <Emmy B> Very dangerous for WL that CIA’s head brings up the murder/execution of Richard Welsh CIA station master in Athens 1975 (WL GIFiles had some info on him) by “17th of November” in the introduction of his anti-WikiLeaks rant. I doubt he has particular knowledge, who wrote his speech for him and was he written in London perhaps? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Organization_17_November

[2017-04-28 12:25:25] <Emmy B> oh, what a shame, it is not very kind to say ‘never mind’ I think it is a great shame. A lost opportunity. It was so curious that the doc was forever postponed for release, first at Toronto under Field of vision, then at Cannes, now a year later finally out but we really must wait to see it as it is very true that a number of journos just can’t wait to see blemish and they will find it even if it is not there.

[2017-04-28 15:11:49] <Emmy B> I guess, I will stop promoting it then.
[2017-04-29 03:12:09] <WikiLeaks> Just use it to promote the other films
[2017-04-29 05:46:12] <Emmy B> ok, thanks, keep going! <3
[2017-05-01 06:09:58] <LibertarianLibrarian> Oh, that’s awful to hear. Both Julian and Jake have suffered enough. And I’d been looking forward to seeing it. 🙁
[2017-05-01 06:23:07] <Emmy B> Let’s hope Jacob has good support in the next few months and I mean psychological support for the attack.
[2017-05-01 06:24:45] <Emmy B> Also hopefully he will not be forced to react other through his lawyers if he has to.
[2017-05-01 06:27:26] <Emmy B> Primarily he must look after his wellbeing and not to ‘accept the challenge’ and feed the media frenzy.
[2017-05-01 06:55:29] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes. Hopefully his doctoral work is going well and he’s too busy with that. It still stuns me how so many people just turned on him like that. Hell of an organized smear campaign. Hate knowing that you can- trust people you thought you could.
[2017-05-01 06:57:20] <LibertarianLibrarian> That’s can’t.
[2017-05-01 07:47:50] <Emmy B> well… you know… s-e-x … so much trouble!!!! but what can we do? the world has to be populated hahaha, sorry, this is all very serious, especially if it becomes life threatening situation with all the backlash. For the people directly involved it is tragic, for the rest of us, well it diverts from the power political nature of the story into yet again sex and its politics. Considering it is a documentary perhaps one has to enquire if it is autobiographical at the end of the day saying more about the film maker rather than its object, the story. If the Filmmaker becomes the story rather than the minstrel then what do we have?
[2017-05-01 07:50:41] <Emmy B> I would love to see all versions of it, as ‘Asylum’ Sep 2016, ‘Risk’ April 2016, ‘Risk’ May 2017 and compare and contrast, but perhaps, at the end of the day, it is not so important.
[2017-05-01 07:51:05] <Emmy B> sorry, ‘Asylum’ Sep 2015
[2017-05-01 10:18:38] <WikiLeaks> She broke all her written and verbal agreements. She’s the daughter of a billionaire. Pretty boring US imperialism. Make agreements with the natives, predate on some young ones for good measure, get the loot, break the agreements, smuggle it back to the US and profit.
[2017-05-01 10:20:25] <WikiLeaks> Profit matrix changed due to DNC and jakegate. She’d have been exposed as sleeping with her subjects and making them appear positive after jakegate, so she had to attack them instead to defend against accusations of crossing the line.
[2017-05-01 10:21:25] <WikiLeaks> Meh. All so predictable. We knew after jakegate the film would be serious trouble.
[2017-05-01 10:23:32] <WikiLeaks> He never should have had more than a bit role in the first place, since he’s never worked on a single WL publication. She gave him equal airtime to JA since he was her boyfriend. Then she was too lazy to redo the whole film after jakegate, so she just reframed it all with a narrative spin.
[2017-05-01 10:28:57] <WikiLeaks> Make a pro-WL film with a haigiographic depiction of your sex-accused boyfriend would have been the end of her oscar ambitions in the US for a few years given the current climate in the limo-left around Tribecca.
[2017-05-01 10:30:24] <WikiLeaks> Would be nice to believe she just wanted to get back at jake but that presumes some humanity that probably isn’t there.
[2017-05-01 10:32:18] <WikiLeaks> Them after the Pompeo attack she didn’t have time to pivot again, so now the film is naster than her profit matrix requires. Oh well.
[2017-05-01 10:41:43] <Emmy B> I am very sorry

[2017-05-01 14:01:16] <Emmy B> Thx WiseUp noticed the same, of concern.
[2017-05-01 14:20:10] <WikiLeaks> Good idea.
[2017-05-01 14:20:44] <WikiLeaks> Yes. They may attempt to instrumentalize her to distance herself from WL.
[2017-05-01 14:57:32] <WikiLeaks> [Card-summary_large_image] http://fanboynation.com/risk-2017/
[2017-05-01 15:28:40] <Emmy B> I know it hurts WL/JA but lets just remember the thousands upon thousands of people who have benefitted from WL/JA’s work in a very profound way, to them this doctored doc means nothing. Take heart, the world is a big place and full of love for those like WL that do good work. There have been so many disappointments along this journey, but my goodness, how many victories, remember the superpower of the accused. <3
[2017-05-01 15:32:33] <Emmy B> and remember the victories that WL has won, it has won them for the world, now who can do better than that?
[2017-05-01 17:07:46] <LibertarianLibrarian> Sad to see Laura sell out herself, WL, and Jake, plus basic honesty and the importance of WL and all it has accomplished.
[2017-05-01 17:10:30] <LibertarianLibrarian> But you never know, it can still open eyes and make people think. As terrible as it was, The 5th Estate made me investigate the truth about JA & WL and listening to the real JA made a huge change in how I think and see the world me.
[2017-05-01 17:11:00] <LibertarianLibrarian> ‘Around me’
[2017-05-01 17:32:37] <Emmy B> Always a silver lining 🙂
[2017-05-01 17:47:51] <WikiLeaks> [Card-summary_large_image] http://www.scpr.org/programs/the-frame/2017/05/01/56485/laura-poitras-confronts-contradictions-about-julia/ she’s backpeddling
[2017-05-01 17:49:41] <WikiLeaks> And lying. Note on the ‘shaking’ footage, actually, JA is tapping his leg. We told her for two years to not use it because it looks like shaking.
[2017-05-01 22:25:18] <Emmy B> whatever I say it’s not going to make it better considering it is a betrayal, the voice over alone makes it a departure from any pretence of objectivity. But I have not seen it, when I will I will have more to say.
[2017-05-02 11:20:28] <LibertarianLibrarian> Oh good grief. All that time & work and she doesn’t have enough pride in it or responsibility for it, to present it honesty? Maybe it’s because I provide medical information to doctors and patient families that can affect a child’s health and life, but it just blows my mind when people misrepresent reality so casually. It’s not even a pure fact versus dramatic presentation difference, much in pediatrics is based on limited evidence and clinician judgement, but just just an ethos of personal responsibility and trust when what you do and say impacts people’s lives. Never understood deliberate lying or falsifying or shading truth just out of greed or ambition.
[2017-05-02 11:22:06] <LibertarianLibrarian> I know it’s a staple of politics and etc. But… I’m just disgusted.
[2017-05-02 11:28:03] <WISE Up Action> Unfortunately the cachet of an award winner gives her opportunity to spin this without critique, and very few will know the true story. 🙁
[2017-05-02 13:56:57] <Emmy B> [Card-summary_large_image] http://www.newsweek.com/director-laura-poitras-discusses-film-julian-assange-593039 In this Newsweek interview LP defends WL/JA against what the interviewer puts forward after watching the film. It is an interesting duality, LP bakes a chocolate cake for commercial consumption, the packing house (journo) is trying to wrap it in a chocolate cake wrapping paper advertising how chocolatee it tastes, she objects at the wrapping paper insisting sit tastes of coconut and as the baker she is the authority on the cake…hmm… but one can’t have their cake and eat it. She can’t have it both ways or can she?
[2017-05-02 14:38:45] <LibertarianLibrarian> It’s going to be very interesting to see the final version (would love to see earlier ones as well). I suspect that she may be trying to walk a high wire without falling off. After everything, she’d look absolutely horrible if throws WL & JA under a bus yet she’s trying to distance herself enough to ‘fit in with the cool kids’ so to speak.
[2017-05-02 23:38:28] <Emmy B> [Card-summary_large_image] http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/knBjX/vill-att-sverige-haver-haktning-av-assange Swedish Newspaper reports Samuelson petitions the Stockholm District Court to dismiss Swedish arrest warrant against Julian Assange to allow him to travel to Ecuador.
[2017-05-03 05:55:21] <LibertarianLibrarian> Got to wonder when even Swedish courts are going to start realizing the utter absurdity of the so-called allegations.
[2017-05-03 06:36:36] <Emmy B> I don’t think the Swedish Courts will ever get the chance to consider any of the actual facts of the non-case against JA. So far in 6 yrs they have focused on procedural matters and requirements which strengthened the Swedish Prosecutors procrastination strategy to the point they both could. But! the current legal motion is the one that ties in with the CIA’s historic role of collaboration of the Swedish Political world and perhaps even judicial regarding the illegal renditions, and the one that could, take the Swedish state once again in front the European Court of Human Rights.
[2017-05-03 09:16:17] <LibertarianLibrarian> Keeping the pressure and public eye on them and their absurd behavior is always good. Just keep hoping some judge is going to finally get frustrated and embarrassed enough to toss it out.
[2017-05-03 09:19:47] <Emmy B> Wouldn’t that be wonderful? *yeah* 😀
[2017-05-03 10:11:30] <Emmy B> [Card-summary] http://canadafreepress.com/article/the-role-of-the-cias-john-brennan I think this is a very important article in its perspective, linking Democrats in funding Christopher Steel’s ‘Trump Dossier’ as a reaction to WL’s announcement that a Clinton release was in the pipeline.

Will be very interesting to attend any way 🙂
[2017-05-05 06:33:39] <Emmy B> The more LP talks about ‘Risk’ the more I think less of her. Such a pity. I read all the reviews hoping that at least the doc might have original footage that could add something, one bit of something new or of interest, so far nothing of what has been reported is vaguely newsworthy to me, but perhaps because I have followed the story closely, still, you kind of hope that a documentary might actually bring something new to the public. I booked a ticket for the film’s UK premier in June but it might be it’s not the effort.
[2017-05-05 06:55:13] <WikiLeaks> [Card-summary] https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fs%2Fw699ziol03e0bf4%2FRisk%2520%282017%29%2520Q%26A%2520with%2520Director%2520Laura%2520Poitras.mp3%3Fdl%3D0%3AGCK73h38iSVVew4BgzAGDW7ltB4&cuid=3495889 LP lies to Scahill’s face here:
[2017-05-05 06:56:03] <WikiLeaks> There were of course extensive written contracts and verbal assurances covering recordings of legal meetings (and everything else).
[2017-05-05 06:57:41] <WikiLeaks> “Why does he trust me?” — because of explicit contracts.
[2017-05-05 06:58:04] <WikiLeaks> And WL took physical possession of all footage at the end of each recording.
[2017-05-05 07:00:12] <Emmy B> That was sensible.
[2017-05-05 07:02:09] <Emmy B> I’ve got to go now but I will listen to the podcast later, thank you very much for sharing, it has not come up yet in my google searches. Melinda Taylor did a great job with her article and I think it is right to say she spoke for all of us WL sup which happen to be women.
[2017-05-05 07:02:35] <Emmy B> just keep going! <3
[2017-05-05 08:34:12] <LibertarianLibrarian> Glad WL has the full footage, which can be used to counter any revisionist/out of context clipping. And it stuns me that Poitras would denigrate Sarah Harrison in anyway. Melinda Taylor’s article was excellent.
[2017-05-05 18:54:44] <Emmy B> there is an option missing from Macronleaks intent list : those seeking alliances in the Continent against Whistleblowing protections, consider as an indicator, France political leadership intent to protect Assange, several presidential hopefuls offered protection, reflecting liberal approach, what would they say now? this hack strengthens the arm of Macron to reverse such liberal approach, de license RT, and bring public opinion to the pro censorship side. Who is going to play Crowdstrike’s role? How is this going to influence Data and Communications policy in EU? so perhaps intent is broader to influence EU wide policy and of course yes considering the already fuelled anti-Russian military efforts by Nato at Europe’s eastern border, muzzle public opinion dissent against build up of hostility operations there. Also I am sorry to say they might start treating such incidents as they do terror attacks. Perhaps perhaps perhaps. On the other hand it will be very interesting to see post elections results which French Media will report what from the emails and weather they will ‘ethically’ self censor.
[2017-05-05 19:17:15] <Emmy B> if Ukraine is instrumentalised to influence communication policy in EU in the same manner it has been used to influence military strategy, Cyber warfare strategy will also be steared in the same direction. In the absence of a Britain stearing EU policy the US way due to its weakened Brexit position, Macron may yet play that role in the meanwhile, I mean, when did an Obama endorsed a French presidential candidate the eve of both first and second rounds. The snug is that EU/US policy in the Ukraine has brought about a civil war in that country, if now Ukraine has been instrumentalised to destabilise the EU then what is the expression? “the chickens have come home to roost”

[2017-05-08 08:29:14] <WikiLeaks> Zeynep is dangerous since she infects free speech conference and has a monthly column in the NYT
[2017-05-08 08:29:55] <WikiLeaks> But essentially the entire free speech circuit is underwritten by US, UK and Sweden
[2017-05-08 08:31:29] <WikiLeaks> As they’re all involved in extensive cultural imperialism and cultural content exports it suits them
[2017-05-08 09:22:25] <Emmy B> What an eye opener! But then historically British colonialism thrived as much under Labour as under the Conservatives. So, perhaps we should expect no better, still one must always expect better.

[2017-05-20 23:58:51] <WikiLeaks> Fritz attacking Ny is big news
[2017-05-20 23:59:20] <WikiLeaks> Ny heads up all rape cases in Sweden for a few years now
[2017-05-20 23:59:48] <WikiLeaks> Fritz and her firm nearly entirely do complainants representations in such cases
[2017-05-21 00:00:07] <WikiLeaks> e.g that includes appearing to Ny to do reopens
[2017-05-21 00:01:13] <WikiLeaks> So it means that Fritz thinks that Ny is not worth investing in now. She was previously lock-step with Ny on every issue.
[2017-05-21 00:02:54] <Emmy B> perhaps she’ll retire as Rixstep kept mentioning in the past, an easy way out
[2017-05-21 00:03:54] <Emmy B> can Fritz go to a third prosecutor and ask them to re-open the case?

[2017-05-21 02:25:07] <WikiLeaks> It doesn’t matter what she does. It was always a political case and with Trump and the release of Manning the case is politically dead.
[2017-05-21 02:51:20] <Emmy B> 🙂 Thank goodness for that!
[2017-05-21 08:14:25] <LibertarianLibrarian> I doubt there is anyone in Sweden who would touch it with a ten foot pole. Ny thoroughly embarrassed herself and the entire Swedish system, with UN condemnation to boot.
[2017-05-21 11:27:18] <Bean> so wonderful to see this particular chapter end 🙂 <3
[2017-05-21 11:27:30] <Bean> onto the next anniversary…
[2017-05-21 11:29:38] <Bean> planning graphics for the big 5 year ‘anniversary’, so any rough ideas or specifics re those – including which aspects are a priority for an infographic – would be gratefully appreciated 🙂
[2017-05-21 11:49:09] <Emmy B> yep sending separately 🙂
[2017-05-21 11:57:07] <Bean> great – thx 🙂
[2017-05-21 13:50:32] <Emmy B> Has anyone heard fro Prof Ferrada de Noli? very uncharacteristic of him not to tweet when so much has been going on in Sweden.
[2017-05-21 13:52:16] <Emmy B> Last tweet 18th of May
[2017-05-21 14:29:16] <Emmy B> oh I just heard from him, it’s ok, he’s drafting a new article 🙂
[2017-05-21 14:29:44] <WISE Up Action> Just gonna say – not heard anything!
[2017-05-22 23:52:50] <WISE Up Action> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/charliearchy/status/865381224864333825 Was wondering why the prominent JA image in this story?

[2017-05-23 00:07:37] <Emmy B> Thanks for this W – goodmorning!
[2017-05-23 05:58:57] <Emmy B> Wouldn’t be wonderful to have “UK Election club” broadcast? hehehe
[2017-05-23 05:59:25] <Emmy B> one way or another we need cheering 🙂 it could be fun

[2017-05-23 15:34:19] <Emmy B> one of the many stories in the book of WikiLeaks
[2017-05-24 07:49:54] <Emmy B> My son’s school cancelled school trip to the National Gallery today because of ‘tourirism’ how rare we can get an accidental smile out of this hysteria
[2017-05-24 21:43:17] <Emmy B> Millitaire.gr reports US Admin has requested extended military co-operation btw US GR with focus on upgrading military facilities in the AEGEAN in view of the (now agreed) all NATO offensive on ISIS. A US delegation will visit military facilities in the Aegean. In other articles notes that US interest has been up till now limited and focused on Greece’s Souda bay with developing US Naval facilities in Crete, now the focus will include other islands too, mentions Turkey’s unreliability as a partner for a reason, but of course I see an increased US military presence in the Aegean as strategically controlling the straights into Black see and the Russian fleet stationed there, perhaps limiting its involvement in Syria in support of Assad. Reminder that Nato has already been deployed in the Aegean ‘to control refugee flows from Turkey’ albeit obliged Turkey with avoiding South East part as Turkey claims should be de-militarised due to Lozane treatie and other accords (Greece has militarised parts of the aegean since the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus). Also reports US pressures GR to sign 5 yr rolling accord for the use of Suda to the annually re-newed agreement in place claiming this would allow them to invest further on their Naval base.
[2017-05-24 21:47:18] <Emmy B> Noting that UK MOD recently stated RAF upgraded runway and other facilities in their military sovereign base areas in Cyprus and statement that by 2019 it will be the largest UK deployment abroad, we are in for escalation of conflict in the Middle East.
[2017-05-24 21:51:55] <Emmy B> Greece is a reluctant party and will resist its own military taking any part other than medical/humanitarian as it did in Iraq and Afghanistan but it’s proximity to the area and the use of it’s facilities clearly it involves the entire country in the adventurism perils of Western geopolitics. Trump’s Tomahokes (however you spell them) were anchored at Suda prior to deployment.
[2017-05-24 22:00:37] <Emmy B> Britain’s divide and rule policy in Cyprus eloquently expressed in the 1960 terms of ‘independence’ (that truly never was) continued by US’s Kissinger endorsement and assistance in Turkey’s military invasion in 1974 (with signals assistance from US station in Crete and Israel’s signals too) leaves Greece with no doubt on how determined to harm, its ‘allies’ are. Particularly telling is that not once have either Nato nor US condemned Turkey’s daily air violations in the Aegean that have been forever increasing. As with geopolitics the big players like to have all options on the table.
[2017-05-24 22:08:31] <Emmy B> here is one of the articles https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=el&u=http://www.militaire.gr/%25CE%25B1%25CE%25BC%25CE%25B5%25CF%2581%25CE%25B9%25CE%25BA%25CE%25B1%25CE%25BD%25CE%25B9%25CE%25BA%25CE%25AE-%25CE%25BF%25CE%25BC%25CF%2580%25CF%2581%25CE%25AD%25CE%25BB%25CE%25B1-%25CF%2583%25CF%2584%25CE%25BF-%25CE%25B1%25CE%25B9%25CE%25B3%25CE%25B1%25CE%25AF%25CE%25BF-%25CE%25B5%25CE%25BD%25CE%25B4%25CE%25B9%25CE%25B1/&prev=search

[2017-05-24 22:53:01] <Emmy B> (pincus much?) good morning 🙂
[2017-05-28 13:31:52] <Emmy B> I have come across something strange perhaps WL needs to take a look. The BBC have changed the content of one of their articles completely from 29.05.2012 and recycling part of the content in a new article dated 19.05.2017 with the same URL as the old one. I found this as I attempted to archive the new article at archive.is and got the message that this url has already been archived. Why would the BBC do this? in effect the original article has now been censored. I saved the new article on wayback machine as not to interfere with the archive.is record.
[2017-05-28 13:33:27] <Emmy B> This is the new article: https://web.archive.org/web/20170528202409/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-11047811
[2017-05-28 13:34:03] <Emmy B> [Card-summary] http://archive.is/ED8x This is the old article:
[2017-05-28 13:39:08] <Emmy B> just noticed the wayback machine has 158 captures of the same URL, it is JA’s profile article which constantly changes, so it must be their policy to not change the URL, just like the Wikipedia policy, same URL different content.
[2017-05-28 15:09:27] <WikiLeaks> Interesting. What has been censored?
[2017-05-31 03:47:46] <WISE Up Action> [Card-summary_large_image] http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4557920/Things-looking-Chelsea-Manning-s-seen-NYC.html I hope she’s been looked after and is being careful herself
[2017-06-05 01:50:18] <Emmy B> The sovereign fund of Qatar owns Harrods and surrounding buildings. I hope the current political antagonism will not be brought in the streets of Knightsbridge. Harrods might now be boycotted by other Arabs affecting the bottom line? What will be UK’s stance on this M.E. crisis. There is one factor that has not been substantially taken into account, Al Jazeera and its reach to Western audiences. An important week. Fingers crossed.
[2017-06-05 09:40:06] <Emmy B> Egypt has asked from Greece to be its diplomatic representative in Qatar whilst the diplomatic relations are severed btw the two nations. Greece has always enjoyed very good relations with Egypt but the choice is perhaps an indication of a soft approach to this crisis. Egypt Israel Greece and Cyprus have been coming closer as they have been collaborating in demarcating/recognising eachother’s economic zones in East Med in relation to monetising recently discovered gas reserves in East Med. Who will Turkey represent I wonder?

[2017-06-09 06:05:13] <WISE Up Action> There’s a 3rd recount there tonight apparently as Cons refusing to concede.
Was hoping that Hugo Swire might lose last night, rumours of a challenge, but he was comfortable in the end.
Likely to be some cabinet reshuffling now?
[2017-06-09 06:10:38] <Emmy B> Amazing! If this lady wins we can pen a letter at the solidarity vigil to inform her about the case but will she ever read it? She should visit Julian as he is her constituent (although under asylum within the Ecuadorian Embassy). How can it be that this country ignores the right of an individual to have any political rights or political representation. I am not a British citizen but my local MP is obliged to represent me politically and if I write to them, they are obliged to reply and see to the matter I bring up.
[2017-06-09 06:19:02] <WISE Up Action> Is the emb in Chelsea constituency not Kensington? Boundary very close?
[2017-06-09 06:26:05] <Emmy B> I believe this is the Constituency where the Ecuadorian Embassy resides https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_(UK_Parliament_constituency)

[2017-06-13 00:20:51] <Emmy B> I never read any article giving the details as from a FOIR though, perhaps this is new. One way or another the times is spinning an angle of women politics that might suit the foreign office objectives. Using a line that they think may appeal to a changing public opinion (more aligned with Corbyn HR politics that could accept the release of JA on bases of UN legal opinion)
[2017-06-13 00:23:13] <Emmy B> Interesting that the spokesWOMAN was from the foreign office and not the Home Office, with Sweden turning tail the detention of JA remains a domestic matter more appropriate for a home office spokesperson.
[2017-06-13 00:25:37] <Emmy B> Perhaps there might be a divergence of interests between Home office and foreign office objectives. But with the tsunami of political developments of the last few weeks who can predict what such gov instability might produce

[2017-06-13 07:07:03] <Emmy B> It is too early to speculate the future of the press project it was is very much his creation and he mostly financed it. It has offered a lot to Greece at a time most needed. We shall see what the future will bring for the TPP.

[2017-06-14 23:16:20] <Emmy B> Goodmorning everyone xxx
[2017-06-14 23:19:22] <Emmy B> oh, I got a reply to my letter at the London Assembly, Mr David Kurten again (UKIP) he will put two Assange questions to the London Mayor:
[2017-06-14 23:20:32] <Emmy B> Dear Emilia,
Thanks for the update on the situation of Julian Assange.
I’ll put these written questions to the Mayor in July; unfortunately the deadline for June questions has passed:
Julian Assange (1)
Now that Sweden has withdrawn its arrest warrant for Julian Assange, will the Metropolitan Police re-assign officers posted to watching the Ecuadorian Embassy to more important duties such as keeping the public safe from terrorists?
Julian Assange (2)
Will you lobby the government to overturn the arrest order from the Home Office for a minor breach of bail conditions in June 2012 so that taxpayers money can be spent on more useful policing operations?
If you can think of any other points you would like to put to the Mayor regarding the Metropolitan Police please let me know.
[2017-06-14 23:21:17] <Emmy B> so if anyone has any ideas for a question please let me know
[2017-06-14 23:54:55] <WikiLeaks> Those will go no where and get teh response “no permanent police assigned to outside the embassy”
[2017-06-14 23:57:51] <WikiLeaks> Perhaps one on: will it investigate the decision to spend tens of millions of pounds spying on and attempting to arrest Julian Assange when this money could have gone to protecting us from terrorism?
[2017-06-15 01:16:57] <Emmy B> Thank you I will forward.

[2017-06-19 22:57:08] <Emmy B> [Card-summary_large_image] http://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2017/06/19/theresa-may-branded-worst-pm-living-memory-pamela-anderson/ Good article in the Telegraph (film)
[2017-06-21 05:22:28] <Emmy B> [Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/877501975029575683/877501965818789888/jZPdwVaM.jpg The mask is down via The Times Diplomatic Editor: “It’s time the UK forced Assange out of hiding” http://archive.is/dNzw1
[2017-06-21 05:26:42] <Emmy B> In a way is indicative of the role some journalists play being the mouthpiece of government, especially when the government does not have the guts to speak plainly and truthfully about the motives of its actions. This is what the UK government has not the guts (so far) to say to its public and Roger Boyes seems to say it on their behalf: “Ecuador has to understand: it is not a friendly act to harbour someone who wants to drive a wedge between Britain and its primary ally.”
[2017-06-21 05:36:18] <Emmy B> But (The Times 17th Aug 2012) he had other advise to the British government albeit he is clearly on their side: “If Britain is seriously
considering the physical
eviction of Assange – with all
the ensuing diplomatic risk –
it can mean only that the
British Government has come
to share the US
Administration’s view of the
WikiLeaks founder as public
enemy No 1.
Is there an alternative line
of action? Only this: to allow
Assange virtual squatters
rights in the Ecuadorean
Embassy. Sooner or later
Ecuador will change its
president or simply grow
bored with Assange.
We could be in for the long
haul rather than a dramatic
dawn raid.” https://quakestudies.canterbury.ac.nz/store/download/part/275420

[2017-07-11 13:42:07] <Emmy B> He probably thought WL already had them. Good advise though. Well it is the first time I see US Deep state doing their job so openly and to see all 5 eyes under the CIA direction against the Potus is very interesting. Of course Trump politically is very rightwing, not of my persuasion, but what we see here is the cancelling of politics, when CIA is in cahoots with the Democrat & Republican establishment to get rid of Trump. Imagine what they must have threatened Obama with… we’ll never know.
[2017-07-11 14:03:07] <WISE Up Action> Keep saying it, but interesting times.
[2017-07-11 14:06:34] <WISE Up Action> Seems like some on-going battles /struggles around Trump circle.
[2017-07-11 14:22:01] <Emmy B> In Greece US secret services possibly with other collaborators planned an assassination plan (Pythia) against Right-Wing PM Kostas Karamanlis (it links with the 2004-2005 unlawful interception scandal – The Athens Affair) due to his re-approachment with Russia. Whether they intended to carry it out or they just did it to intimidate, we don’t know but it worked, he resigned after only 2 years in government. The following government of the ‘centre left’ PASOK headed by Clinton’s friend George Papandreou brought the Troika and IMF in spectacularly failing to manage the crisis and he resigned also after 2 years to hand over to a buraucratic coallition gov that lasted 9 months or so, then the right wing party of New Democracy headed by Samaras got elected, ex housemate of George Papandreou in US when they were both studying there, who also governed 2 and a half years till Syriza was elected in January 2015, then we had the ‘No’ referendum, then elections again in Sep 2015. Why I am saying all this? Yes the crisis and effective bankrupsy was the primary reason of the political instability but the complete failure of the political world to deal with the crisis, the rise of the Golden Dawn, points to an assault on democratic sovereignty that its beginning lies in US deep state destabilisation efforts during the Karamanlis government, first with the scandal of the unlawful interception of at least 150 people in government politics and the economy and then planning ‘Pythia’, at least as an assassination threat on Karamanlis if not the actual thing. With a country like Greece with fresh memories of brutal repression (Junta 67-74) etc etc, introducing such destabilisation is crippling to the political world as they do not have confidence they can actually govern the country. They did it with impunity to Greece why they won’t do it to America? Perhaps they always did it but were not found out, now everyone can see (not the details of it) but it is so obvious CIA and the rest of them meddle.

[2017-07-19 15:53:32] <Emmy B> All I got were one liners from the London Mayor! *not happy*
[2017-07-19 23:57:07] <Emmy B> Answer 1 – The Mayor (13-Jul-2017)
As you may be aware there is an active warrant issued by Westminster Magistrate Court for failure to appear, and the MPS are obliged to execute it.
The MPS will provide a level of resourcing which is proportionate to that offence.
[2017-07-19 23:57:43] <Emmy B> Answer 2 – The Mayor (13-Jul-2017)
Julian Assange is subject to arrest under the Bail Act, for breach of conditions laid by the High Court.
This is an operational matter for the MPS who are keeping the situation under review.
[2017-07-19 23:58:48] <Emmy B> Answer 3 – The Mayor (13-Jul-2017)
The allegation that the MPS have spent tens of millions of pounds spying on Julian Assange is incorrect.
There is an active warrant issued by Westminster Magistrate Court for failure to appear, and the MPS are obliged to execute it. This is an operational matter for the police who are continuing to review the situation.
[2017-07-19 23:59:30] <Emmy B> Answer 4 – The Mayor (13-Jul-2017)
The MPS have not engaged any private police contractors operating in the surrounding streets of the Ecuadorian embassy.
Organisations or communities may fund their own security patrols and the MPS will work with personnel in the most appropriate way to prevent and detect crime.
[2017-07-20 00:01:07] <Emmy B> Question 4 was – David Kurten (13-Jul-2017)
Is the Mayor aware of private police contractors operating in Hans Crescent, Basil Street, and surrounding area of Knightsbridge, are they licenced and what is their exact role?
[2017-07-20 00:04:11] <Emmy B> The answer did not really answer the question so it could be an ‘organisation’ or ‘community’ exists that employs private police contractors or security patrols. If they Mayor will not disclose how can I find out?
[2017-07-20 00:04:38] <Emmy B> The Council? The Home Office? a FOIR?
[2017-07-20 02:41:24] <WikiLeaks> They should hammer them for the “not tens of millions” when they themselves said 12.6 million in 2015
[2017-07-20 03:02:01] <Emmy B> Yes!
[2017-07-21 06:02:36] <Emmy B> In the Aspen Security video that WikiLeaks shared today in its timeline, Pompeo mentions that the name of a CIA agent was published which he found unconscionable, to lukewarm applause, when the interviewer asked him ‘Do you talk about Phil Agee?” he says “Excuse me?” the interviewer repeats the name and Pompeo says “I’m sorry I don’t know that name”. Well in his anti-WL speech in April at CSiS https://www.cia.gov/news-information/speeches-testimony/2017-speeches-testimony/pompeo-delivers-remarks-at-csis.html
[2017-07-21 06:04:00] <Emmy B> Who wrote his speech? obviously not himself returning from a trip to London that day.
[2017-07-21 06:05:09] <WikiLeaks> Well spotted. He is not referring to Agee but a NYT reporter.
[2017-07-21 06:16:33] <Emmy B> Embarrassing I thought, some people laughed but probably because they knew who Phillip Agee was. I can understand that perhaps Pompeo was not on best form, but for sure that April speech was not written by him otherwise he would have immediately picked up on the name and say something ‘ no not him’ etc. The interviewer made references to his April speech about WikiLeaks earlier in this interview, so, Pompeo surely would have the April speech fresh in his mind, it did not happen a lifetime away. I guess someone else put Agee in there in the speech as a WikiLeaks/whistleblower equivalent from the past, from during the cold war when the trenches were clear cut and deep. And perhaps wanting to capitalise on Trump’s public opposition to Cuba. Trying to pass Trump & his supporters the message that “I love WikiLeaks” is certainly in the same category/trench as Cuban loving Agee. Who knows.

[2017-07-31 14:38:00] <WikiLeaks> We’re happy with our strategy. 21k we certify, they other’s we don’t (but we very strongly believe that they are all authentic)
[2017-07-31 14:42:40] <Emmy B> Good, it’s great, Congratulations on the new release. Black PR will find any excuse anyways…

Because it is apparently mentioned in court documents I share it here:

A process whereby a Twitter account receives a blue check icon to indicate that the creator of these Tweets is a legitimate source. Verified accounts include public figures and those who may have experienced identity confusion on Twitter.”
[2017-09-04 15:40:27] <Emmy B> plenty of identity confusion with all these fake JA accounts two suspended already but the supply seems limitless!!!
