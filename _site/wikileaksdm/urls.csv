The new deep state reign retains all its business/legal and other societal channels and adding to that the part of society previously excluded or being kept under check the Islamist hopefuls. The presence of Grey Wolves in Syria’s Turkmen community (publicly giving interviews about the shooting down of the Russian pilot) reveals their role and even gives it a public role. In retrospect the Ankara bombings who targeted Kurdish democratic rallies with their high death toll, fits the profile of a Grey Wolves operation. It is alright for Erdogan to conveniently claim ‘it was ISIS’ and fit with West’s political hypocritical rhetoric about giving a damn for a problem they have created and sustain as a tool of furthering their influence and control in the region. The Ankara Bombing of Kurdish political wing by Turkey’s deep state (via Grey Wolves) is no different to them bombing the Kurds in Nothern Iraq overtly. Let’s not forget Grey Wolves attempted to kill Turgut Ozal Turkish Prime Minister in the 80’s so not only their ambitions, properly sheltered by the deep state, have no end, https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19880620&id=7TNAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=T1kMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5252,5375442&hl=en",2015-11-27 02:34:30,Emmy B
